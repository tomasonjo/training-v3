== Exercise 8: Getting Started with Neo4j Query Log Analyzer (Preparations)

Before you begin this exercise, you must use Neo4j Desktop as it is a graph app that executes within a Neo4j Desktop environment.
In addition, you need to make DBMS configuration changes that are not possible when using Neo4j Sandbox or Neo4j Aura.

== Exercise 8: Getting Started with Neo4j Query Log Analyzer (Overview)

In this exercise, you will make some configuration changes to enable query logging.
Then you will install and start using Neo4j Query Log Analyzer.

In this exercise, you will:

* *Exercise 8.1*: Prepare for query logging.
* *Exercise 8.2*: Install the Query Log Analyzer Tool.
* *Exercise 8.3*: Execute some queries that will be logged.
* *Exercise 8.4*: View the queries logged using the Query Log Analyzer Tool.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 8.1: Prepare for query logging (Instructions)

Add these settings to enable query logging:

*Hint*: You can add them to the end of the settings file.


----
dbms.logs.query.enabled=true
# If the execution of query takes more time than this threshold,
# the query is logged. If set to zero then all queries
dbms.logs.query.threshold=100ms
dbms.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.time_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.allocation_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.page_logging_enabled=true
dbms.track_query_cpu_time=true
dbms.track_query_allocation=true
----

== Exercise 8.1: Prepare for query logging  (Solution)

Add these settings to enable query logging:

*Hint*: You can add them to the end of the settings file.

. In Neo4j Desktop click the 3 dots to currently running DBMS.
. Select *Settings* tab.
. Add the following code to the end of this file.


----
dbms.logs.query.enabled=true
# If the execution of query takes more time than this threshold,
# the query is logged. If set to zero then all queries
dbms.logs.query.threshold=100ms
dbms.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.time_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.allocation_logging_enabled=true
dbms.logs.query.page_logging_enabled=true
dbms.track_query_cpu_time=true
dbms.track_query_allocation=true

You are now ready to analyze queries that are logged. (Completed queries).

== Exercise 8.3: Execute some queries that will be logged (Instructions)

. From your main Neo4j Browser session, type `:history` to view many of your past queries. Select a set of them to execute.

. Confirm that the queries have been written to the query.log file.

. Make a note of the location of the query.log file as you will be opening it in the Query Log Analyzer Tool.

== Exercise 8.3: Execute some queries that will be logged (Solution)

. From your main Neo4j Browser session, type `:history` to view many of your past queries. Select a set of them to execute.

. Confirm that the queries have been written to the query.log file.

.. Select the 3 dots to the right of the DBMS.
.. Select *Open Folder > Logs*.
.. Ensure that *query.log* exists in the *logs* folder.

. Make a note of the location of the query.log file as you will be opening it in the Query Log Analyzer Tool.

== Exercise 8.4: View the queries logged using the Query Log Analyzer Tool (Instructions)

. Go to Neo4j Query Log Analyzer Tool.

. Select the query.log file.

. Click Analyze File.

. Explore the queries logged.

== Exercise 8.4: View the queries logged using the Query Log Analyzer Tool (Solution)

. From Neo4j Desktop, open the Neo4j Query Log Analyzer Tool.

. Select the query.log file.

. Click Analyze File.

Depending on what queries were logged, you should now see this:
