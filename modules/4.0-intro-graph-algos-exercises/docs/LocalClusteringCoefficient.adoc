== Local Clustering Coefficient (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup  and load data steps again.

== Local Clustering Coefficient (Graph Catalog)

The projected graphs *roads* and *dach-region* should be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you should see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the graph catalog steps again.

== Local Clustering Coefficient (Overview)

The Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm computes the local clustering coefficient for each node in the graph.
The lcc of a node describes the likelihood that the neighbours of the node are also connected.
It is used to determine how tightly-knit the nodes in a network are.

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher to implement the local clustering coefficient algorithm using the European Roads dataset.

* *Part 1*: Determine the average local clustering coefficient.
* *Part 2*: Determine the local clustering coefficient for each *Place* node.
* *Part 3*: Verify the clustering coefficient results

== Part 1: Determine the average local clustering coefficient (Instructions)

Write a query to determine the average local clustering coeffient for the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following result: averageClusteringCoefficient.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stats`.

== Part 1: Determine the average local clustering coefficient (Solution)

Write a query to determine the average local clustering coeffient for the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following result: averageClusteringCoefficient.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stats`.

The average clustering coefficient for the European roads network is fairly low, which indicates that the nodes are not tighly-knit.
In a typical online social network, you can expect higher average clustering coefficient scores.

== Part 2: Determine the triangle count for each *Place* node. (Instructions)

Write a query to determine the local clustering coeffient for each *Place* node in the European road network.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: nodeId, localClusteringCoefficient
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by local clustering coefficient score descending.
* Limit the top ten results.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream`.

== Part 2: Determine the triangle count for each Place node. (Solution)

Write a query to determine the local clustering coeffient for each *Place* node in the European road network.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: nodeId, localClusteringCoefficient
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by local clustering coefficient score descending.
* Limit the top ten results.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream`.

[source, cypher]

CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream('roads')
YIELD nodeId, localClusteringCoefficient
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, localClusteringCoefficient
ORDER BY localClusteringCoefficient DESC
LIMIT 10

A node has a maximum value of local clustering coefficient(1), when each its neighbours has a connection to all the other neighbours. 

== Part 3: Verify the clustering coefficient results. (Instructions)

Let's confirm that the clustering coefficient score of 1 for the *Antwerpen* node is correct.

Write a query to match *Antwerpen* and its neighbours.
Include connections between neighbours.

*Hint*: Use the variable-length pattern matching.

== Part 3: Verify the clustering coefficient results. (Solution)

Let's confirm that the clustering coefficient score of 1 for the *Antwerpen* node is correct.

Write a query to match *Antwerpen* and its neighbours.
Include connections between neighbours.

*Hint*: Use the variable-length pattern matching.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path=(p:Place{name:'Antwerpen'})-[*..2]-(neighbour)
WHERE (p)--(neighbour)
RETURN path
----

The results should be:

Antwerpen belongs to a single triangle and has no other connections.
This confirms that the correct clustering coefficient score for the Antwerpen node is indeed 1.

== Local Clustering Coefficient: Taking it further

. Try using the write mode of the algorithm.
. Try different configuration values.

== Local Clustering Coefficient (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Local Clustering coefficient algorithm to return the clustering coefficient for the *Place* nodes of the European Roads dataset.
