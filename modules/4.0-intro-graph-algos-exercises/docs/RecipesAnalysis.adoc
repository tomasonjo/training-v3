== Recipe analysis (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup  and load data steps again.

== Recipe analysis (Overview)

Combine the knowledge esse

PageRank measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes.
It can be computed by iteratively distributing one node’s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbors.

In this exercise, you will analyze PageRank for the European Roads dataset:

* *Part 1*: Perform the node similarity algorithm in mutate mode.
* *Part 2*: Perform Louvain to find communities of dishes.
* *Part 2*: Use graph export to export to a new database.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Part 1: Perform the PageRank algorithm. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to perform PageRank analysis on the roads networks using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Use the graph from the graph catalog
* Specify a maximum of 20 iterations.
* Specify a dampening factor of .85.
* Return the results ordering by *score*.
* Limit the top ten results

*Hint*: Call `gds.pageRank.stream`.

== Part 1: Perform the PageRank algorithm. (Solution)

Write Cypher code to perform PageRank analysis on the *Place* nodes using the *EROADS* relationship using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Use the graph from the graph catalog
* Specify a maximum of 20 iterations.
* Specify a dampening factor of .85.
* Return the results ordering by *score*.
* Limit the top ten results

*Hint*: Call `gds.pageRank.stream`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('roads', 
    {maxIterations:20, dampingFactor:0.85})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

Here we see that Berlin, Budapest, and Praha are the most popular places.

== Perform the weighted variant of the PageRank algorithm. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to perform the weighted variant of the PageRank analysis on the roads networks using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Use the same parameters as before.
* Add the *relationshipWeightProperty* parameter


== Perform the weighted variant of the PageRank algorithm. (Solution)

Write Cypher code to perform the weighted variant of the PageRank analysis on the roads networks using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Use the same parameters as before.
* Add the *relationshipWeightProperty* parameter

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('roads',{
    maxIterations:20, dampingFactor:0.85, 
    relationshipWeightProperty:'inverse_distance'})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

The results are quite different to before when we take the inverse distance into account.

== Perform the Personalized PageRank algorithm. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to perform the weighted variant of the PageRank analysis on the roads networks using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Use the same parameters as before.
* Input the Madrid node as the input of the *sourceNodes* parameter

== Perform the Personalized PageRank. (Solution)

Write Cypher code to perform the weighted variant of the PageRank analysis on the roads networks using these guidelines:

* Use the stream variation of the algorithm.
* Use the same parameters as before.
* Input the Madrid node as the input of the *sourceNodes* parameter

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Place)
WHERE p.name = 'Madrid'
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('roads', {
    maxIterations:20, dampingFactor:0.85, 
    sourceNodes:[p]})
YIELD nodeId, score
WHERE nodeId <> id(p)
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

We expect that the neighbouring places of Madrid will have a higher rank due to personalization.

== PageRank: Taking it further

. Change the iterations and dampening factor to see how it affects the results.
. Change the sourceNodes parameter to see how it affects the results.
. Try using the non-stream version of the algorithm.

== PageRank (Summary)

PageRank measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes.
It can be computed by iteratively distributing one node’s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbors.

In this exercise, you analyzed PageRank for the European Roads dataset.
