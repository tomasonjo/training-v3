== Betweenness Centrality (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup  and *Load Data* steps.

== Betweenness Centrality (Graph Catalog)

The projected graphs *roads* and *dach-region* should be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you should see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the *Graph Catalog* steps.

== Betweenness Centrality (Overview)

The Betweenness centrality algorithm detects the amount of influence a node has over the flow of information in a graph.
It is often used to find nodes that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to another.

The algorithm calculates the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph, and the nodes that most frequently occur on these paths will have the highest score.

In this exercise, you will execute betweenness centrality algorithm on the European Roads dataset:

* *Part 1*: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis.
* *Part 1*: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis on the DACH region of the network.
* *Part 2*: Perform a variation of Betweenness Centrality analysis: Randomized-Approximate Brandes.

== Part 1: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis. (Instructions)

Write the Cypher code to perform the stream variation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm. It will return nodeId and score value.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by betweenness centrality score descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.

*Hint*: Call `gds.betweenness.stream` with no other special configuration values.

----
CALL gds.betweenness.stream('roads')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

Berlin is quite important by both the PageRank and Betweenness centrality score.
The most influental bridge in the network is Wien, followed by Paris.

The most influental bridges in the DACH area are München and Nürnberg.

== Part 3: Perform a variation of Betweenness Centrality analysis: Randomized-Approximate Brandes. (Instructions)

On very large graphs it is not really feasible to run all these shortest path computations, so we might choose to use an approximate version of the algorithm.
Write the Cypher code to perform the Randomized-Approximate variation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
It will return nodeId and score value.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Add the *samplingSize* parameter.
* Specify the sampling size of 100.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Limit it to the top ten results.


*Hint*: Call `gds.betweenness.stream`

The following query runs the RA-Brandes algorithm which calculates betweenness based on sampling parts of the graph:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.betweenness.stream('roads', {
    samplingSize:100})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10

You should see similar results as with the original algorithm. Due to randomness, each result will be slightly different.

Try running this algorithm a few times to see how the results change.

== Betweenness Centrality: Taking it further

Try the Randomized-Approximate Brandes analysis with different values for:

* samplingSize
* samplingSeed

== Betweenness Centrality (Summary)

Betweenness centrality is one of the centrality measures to help you identify important nodes in the graph.

In this exercise, you ran a betweenness centrality algorithm on the European Roads dataset.
