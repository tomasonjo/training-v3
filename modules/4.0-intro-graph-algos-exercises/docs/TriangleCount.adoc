== Triangle Count (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup  and *Load Data* steps.


== Triangle Count (Graph Catalog)

The projected graphs *roads* and *dach-region* should be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you should see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the *Graph Catalog* steps.

== Triangle Count (Overview)

The Triangle Count algorithm counts the number of triangles for each node in the graph.
A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node has a relationship to the other two.
The implementation in the GDS library only finds triangles in undirected graphs.

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher code to implement the Triangle count algorithm using the European Roads dataset.

* *Part 1*: Run the Triangle Count algorithm to add a triangles property to each node.
* *Part 2*: Inspect the results of the algorithm.
* *Part 3*: Examine the triangles of a single place.
* *Part 4*: Run the Triangle Count algorithm on the DACH subgraph.

== Part 1: Run the Triangle Count algorithm to add a triangles property to each node. (Instructions)

Write a query to perform the Triangle Count algorithm on the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* The algorithm will write a property named *triangles* to each node with the computed value.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangleCount.write`.

== Part 1: Retrieve the triangles in the European Roads dataset. (Solution)

Write a query to perform the Triangle Count algorithm on the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* The algorithm will write a property named *triangles* to each node with the computed value.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangleCount.write`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.triangleCount.write('roads',
   {writeProperty:'triangles'})
YIELD globalTriangleCount, nodeCount
RETURN globalTriangleCount, nodeCount
----

The results returned should look like this:

There are 894 nodes and only 22 triangles in the whole graph.
This indicates that the European roads network is very sparse.

== Part 2: Inspect the results of the algorithm (Instructions)

Write a query to return all *Place* nodes and their triangle count property.

* Order the results by triangles descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.

== Part 2: Inspect the results of the algorithm (Solution)

Write a query to return all *Place* nodes and their triangle count property.

* Order the results by triangles descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Place)
RETURN p.name as place,
       p.triangles as triangles
ORDER BY triangles DESC
LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

Antwerpen has the most triangles.

== Part 3: Examine the triangles of a single place (Instructions/Solution)

Write a query to match Antwerpen and its neighbours.
Include connections between neighbours.

*Hint*: Use the variable-length pattern matching.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path=(p:Place{name:'Antwerpen'})-[*..2]-(neighbour)
WHERE (p)--(neighbour)
RETURN path
----

The results returned should look like this:

Breda, Eindhoven, and Antwerpen form a triangle.
Zeebrugge does not form any triangles with Antwerpen as it has no connections to any of its neighbours.

== Run the Triangle Count algorithm on the DACH subgraph (Instructions)

Write a query to perform the Triangle Count algorithm on the DACH region of the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *dach-region*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by triangles count descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.

*Hint*: Call `gds.triangleCount.stream`

== Run the Triangle Count algorithm on the DACH subgraph (Solution)

Write a query to perform the Triangle Count algorithm on the DACH region of the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *dach-region*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by triangles count descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.

*Hint*: Call `gds.triangleCount.stream`

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.triangleCount.stream('dach-region')
YIELD nodeId, triangleCount
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name as place, triangleCount
ORDER BY triangleCount DESC 
LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

There are only six triangles in the DACH region of the European roads network.

== Triangle Count: Taking it further

* Try different configuration values.

== Triangle Count (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Triangle count algorithm to return the count of triangles for the *Place* nodes of the European Roads dataset.
