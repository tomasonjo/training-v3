== Community Detection algorithms

Community Detection algorithms are designed to help you discover and understand the structure of complex networks.

[.notes]
--
Understanding the community structure has many real-world applications in sociology, biology, and computer science.
You can think of a community as a densely-connected group of nodes, similar to how a group of friends is highly interconnected.
--

These algorithms are supported:

[square]
* Weakly Connected Components (unionFind)
* Label Propagation
* Louvain Modularity
* Triangle Counting
* Local Clustering Coefficient

Labs implementations:

[square]
* Strongly Connected Components
* K-1 Coloring
* Modularity optimization

== Weakly Connected Components

The Weakly Connected Components (WCC) algorithm is used to find disconnected subgraphs or islands within our network.

[.notes]
--
In a single connected component, each node can reach all other nodes when disregarding relationships' direction, effectively treating the connections as undirected.
Understanding how many connected components exist in our network is crucial to understanding the graph structure.
For that reason, the WCC algorithm is often used early in graph analysis.
A best practice is to run WCC to test whether a graph is connected as a preparatory step for all other graph algorithms.
Performing this quick test can avoid accidentally running algorithms on only one disconnected component of a graph and getting incorrect results.
It can also help you to better comprehend results from other algorithms.
--

=== Why use Weakly Connected Components?

[.notes]
--
Here is why you use WCC:

[square]
* Early step in graph analysis to see how a network is connected
* Fraud detection

Here are some examples:

[square]
* Finding common identifiers in disambiguation process.
* Identifying disconnected subgraphs to run resource intensive algorithms (like Node Similarity) in parallel.

[NOTE]
Before you perform the tasks in this Guided Exercise, you must have either created and started the database in the Neo4j Desktop, and followed the instructions for loading the data in the Browser Guide:  `:play 4.0-intro-graph-algos-exercises`.

Show the students the basics of using NEuler and have them do the same on their systems:

. Let's look at how to use the Connected Component algorithm in NEuler to discover how specific types of nodes are connected in the graph, regardless of the direction of their relationhips.
. Since we previously added more nodes and relationships to the database, we must refresh NEuler to ensure that all nodes are known.
. We select the Community detection group of algorithms.
. Then we select the Connected components algorithm.
. We want to discover how Person nodes are related to each other using the HELPS relationship. We select the *Person* label and *HELPS* relationship type.
. We leave the Store results box checked as well as the other default values. Here the default value for the number of nodes per community is 10 which is fine for our small dataset.
. Now we run the algorithm.
. Here are the table results.
. In the visualization, we see that all nodes have a community value of 0 because they are all in the same undirected group.
. Here is the generated code. It has the parameter settings, the call to the algorithm, and Cypher code to retrieve the nodes.
. You can also use the generated code for the named graph, in cases where you want to save intermediate graphs for further downstream processing in your workflow.
. In NEuler, you can copy the generated code from NEuler to Neo4j Browser as a Browser Guide.
. When we play this Browser Guide, we can repeat the same code and you can use this code as part of your application logic.
. In the graph retrieved by the generated code, here, we see that all nodes are reachable, regardless of direction to each other. All nodes receive the community value of 0 because they are all in the same connected group.
. Additionally, in NEuler, if you return to the configuration for an algorithm, it shows the last configuration that was used.
. You can click Edit configuration if you want to make changes to rerun the algorithm.
. If you want to clear the configuration and start again with the defaults, simply click another algorithm and then go back to the algorithm where you will see the default values again.
. This concludes our look at running the Connected Component algorithm in NEuler.

== Label Propagation

The Label Propagation algorithm (LPA) is a fast algorithm for describing communities in a graph.
It detects these groups using network topology alone, and does not require any prior information about the communities, or their structure.

[.notes]
--
In the LPA, the nodes select their community based on their direct neighbors using the node labels.
In addition, weights on nodes and relationships can also be considered.
The idea is that a single label can quickly become dominant in a densely-connected group of nodes, but it will have trouble crossing a sparsely connected region.
--

image::label-propagation-explanation.png[Label propagation explanation,width=800, align=center]

[.notes]
--
Here is how the Label Propagation algorithm works.
First, every node is initialized with a property.
By default, the initial property is unique for every node.
However, the LPA also lends itself well to semi-supervised learning because you can seed the initial properties with pre-assigned node labels that you know are predictive.

In this example, we have started with 2 _A_ nodes, but left all other nodes as unique.
We are using the node default weights of _1_.
Nodes are then processed randomly, with each node acquiring its neighbor's label with the maximum weight. 
So, in the first iteration, the left _A_ acquires the label _F_, _B_ acquires the label _D_, and _C_ now becomes _A_.
The maximum weight is calculated based on the weights of neighbor nodes and their relationships.
In addition, ties are broken uniformly and randomly.
There will be times when a label is not updated because the neighbor with the maximum weight has the same label.
Iterations continue until each node has the majority label of its neighbors or reached the maximum iteration limit.
A maximum iteration limit will prevent endless cycles where the algorithm cannot converge on a solution, essentially getting caught in a flip-flop cycle for some labels.
In contrast to other algorithms, LPA can return different community structures when run multiple times on the same graph.
The order in which LPA evaluates nodes can influence the final communities it returns.
Another factor is the random tie-breaking process.

Here are some examples:

[square]
* Assigning polarity of tweets as a part of semantic analysis. In this scenario, positive and negative seed labels from a classifier are used in combination with the Twitter follower graph. For more information, see https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2140465[Twitter polarity classification with label propagation over lexical links and the follower graph].
* Finding potentially dangerous combinations of possible co-prescribed drugs, based on the chemical similarity and side effect profiles. This  study is found https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2140465[here].

Show the students the basics of using NEuler and have them do the same on their systems:

. Let's look at some of the ways to use the Label Propagation algorithm in NEuler to categorize groups of nodes based upon their relationships in the graph and the weights of their relationships.
. We have selected the Community Detection group of algorithms.
. We select the Label Propagation algorithm.
. We want to create lpa values for the *Person* nodes that are connected by the *HELPS* relationship.
. At this point, we don't care about relationship direction and we will not use any weights for the relationships.
. We leave the remaining settings with their default values.
. Now we run the algorithm.
. Here are the table results. Notice that this algorithm has identified two communities, one with 2 nodes and one with 4 nodes.
. And when we view the visualization, we see that each community is represented by a different color.
. In NEuler, during your session, it keeps a history of the algorithms that you have run. You can navigate to them here.
. Or, if you are in a particular view for the running of an algorithm, if you select the Configuration, you can click Edit configuration, to modify what you last used for running the algorithm.
. Suppose we select the Natural relationship orientation, meaning that the direction of the relationship is significant.
. When we run the algorithm, we see that the visualization is different because we are using direction as a qualifier.
. Next, we  return to the previous configuration and click Edit configuration again to select the Weight property to be 'weight'.
. When we run the algorithm, we see a different result because we are using relationship direction and weight to determine the grouping.
. Here is the generated code for setting the parameters, running the algorithm, and retrieving the nodes.
. And finally, we can generate the Browser Guide for this algorithm and copy it to Neo4j Browser.
. This concludes our look at how to run the Label Propagation algorithm and how changing parameters will influence the lpa property that is written to the nodes.

== Louvain Modularity

The Louvain Modularity algorithm is used to detect communities in large networks.
You can think of the algorithm doing a "what if" analysis to try out various groupings with the goal of eventually reaching a global modularity optimum. 

[.notes]
--
The Louvain Modularity algorithm consists of repeated application of two steps.
The first step is a “greedy” assignment of nodes to communities, favoring local optimizations of modularity.
The modularity score quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities.
This process evaluates how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.
It starts by calculating the change in modularity if that node joins a community with each of its immediate neighbors.
The node then joins the node with the highest modularity change.
The process is repeated for each node until the optimal communities are formed.
The second step is defining a new coarse-grained network, based on the communities found in the first step. 
These two steps are repeated until no further modularity-increasing reassignments of communities are possible.
--

image::louvain-modularity.png[Louvain Modularity,width=500, align=center]

[.notes]
--
In this example, we can see how the Louvain Modularity algorithm works.
First, the algorithm assigns nodes to communities by favoring local optimization of modularity.
In our case, the algorithm found four groups of nodes, which are indicated by node color.
In the second step, the algorithm merges each group of nodes into a single node.
The count of links between nodes within the same community and between various communities is now represented as a weighted relationship between the newly-merged nodes.
Once the new network is created, the whole process is repeated until a modularity maximum is reached.
The Louvain Modularity algorithm is interesting, because you can observe both the final as well as the intermediate communities that are calculated at the end of each level.
It is regarded as a hierarchical clustering algorithm because a hierarchy of communities is produced as a result.
As a rule of thumb, the communities on lower levels are smaller and more fine-grained than the communities found on higher and final levels.

=== Why use Louvain Modularity?

* Community detection in large networks
* Uncover hierarchical structures in data
* Evaluate different grouping thresholds

Here are some examples:

[square]
* Extracting topics from online social platforms, like Twitter and YouTube, based on the co-occurence of terms in documents as part of the topic modeling process.

* Finding hierarchical community structures within the brain’s functional network.

* Evaluating criminal networks and holes in the structure.

. Let's refine the algorithm to use the the Natural relationship orientation, meaning that the direction of the relationship is significant.
. We run the algorithm to see that we still have 2 communities, but the louvain values are different because we specified direction of the relationship.
. We return to edit the configuration again and we select the Weight property to be 'weight'.
. We also select the Intermediate communities check box so that we will determine communities and intermediate communities of this graph.
. We run the algorithm and view the table results. Here we see two communities and one community has 2 sub-communities.
. And here is the generated code with the parameter settings, running the algorithm, and retrieving the nodes.
. Finally, we can copy the generated Browser Guide to Neo4j Browser.

== Triangle Count

[.notes]
--
A triangle contains three nodes where each node has a connection to the other two.
In graph theory terminology, a triangle is equivalent to a 3-clique.
--
The Triangle Count algorithm counts the number of triangles for each node in the graph.

[.notes]
--
It has gained popularity in social network analysis, where it is used to measure the cohesiveness and stability of networks.
It is also one of the indices used in the computation of the local clustering coefficients.
--

[NOTE]
The Triangle Count algorithm in the GDSL only finds triangles in undirected graphs.

image::triangle-count.png[Triangle Count,width=500, align=center]

[.notes]
--
In this example, we count the number of triangles passing through node _U_.
In the left example, two triangles pass through node _U_.
The first triangle consists of node _U_ and left-side nodes and the second triangle consists of node _U_ and bottom-side nodes.
In the second example, we connect the top right nodes, which produces another triangle.

== Local Clustering Coefficient

The Local Clustering Coefficient is the probability that neighbors of a particular node are connected to each other.

[.notes]
--
The goal of the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm is to measure how tightly a group is clustered compared to how tightly it could be clustered.
The algorithm uses Triangle Count in its calculations, which provides a ratio of existing triangles to possible relationships.
A maximum value of _1_ indicates a clique, where every node is connected to every other node.
--

image::clustering-coefficient.png[Clustering Coefficient,width=500, align=center]

[.notes]
--
The Local Clustering Coefficient describes how many of the node's neighbors are also connected.
In the left example, the probability of node _U_ neighbors being connected is 20%.
Node _U_ has five neighbors.
If all the neighbors were connected to each other, that would be ten relationships between neighbors.
Because there are only two relationships between neighbors, the Local Clustering Coefficient is 0.2.
