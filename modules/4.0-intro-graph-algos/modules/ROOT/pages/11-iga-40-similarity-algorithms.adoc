== Similarity algorithms

[.notes]
--
Similarity algorithms evaluate how alike nodes are at an individual level based on node properties, neighboring nodes, or relationship properties.
--

Product supported:

[square]
* Node Similarity (Jaccard Index)

Labs implementations:

[square]
* Cosine Similarity
* Euclidean Similarity
* Overlap Similarity
* Pearson Similarity
* Approximate Nearest Neighbors

== Node Similarity algorithm

The Node Similarity algorithm computes similarities between pairs of nodes based on the Jaccard Similarity Score.
Two nodes are considered similar if they share many of the same neighbors.

[.notes]
--
The input of this algorithm is usually a bipartite graph containing two disjoint node sets.
The Node Similarity algorithm compares all nodes from the first node set based on their relationships to nodes in the second set.
The output of the algorithm is a unipartite network between nodes in the first node set.
We can think of this process as translating indirect relationships to direct ones.
Mathematically, Jaccard Similarity Score is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets.

=== Example: Node Similarity

[.notes]
--
For example, if Basket _A_ contains {Orange, Banana, Cherry}  and Basket _B_ contains {Orange, Banana, Apple,Kiwi} then the Jaccard algorithm counts 2 co-occurrences {Orange, Banana} and divides that count by the number of items in _A_ and _B_ (while not double-counting items), in this case 5 {Orange, Banana, Apple, Cherry, Kiwi}.
The resulting Jaccard Similarity Coefficient is 2/5 which is 0.4.
A coefficient of 1 indicates that the compared sets are identical.

[square]
* Find recommendations of similar items
* First step of analyzing a bipartite network
* Part of link prediction analysis

Show the students the basics of using NEuler and have them do the same on their systems:

. Let's look at how to use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm in NEuler to create a jaccard value for each node which indicates how many nodes are connected to the same nodes.
. We select the Similarity group of algorithms.
. Then we select the Jaccard algorithm.
. Let's select the *Any* label and *HAS_TAG* relationship type.
. We do not want to store anything back to the graph so we de-select store results here.
. Then we run the algorithm.
. Here are the table results.
. We return to the configuration to edit it.
. We modify the last configuration to use *REVERSE* direction.
. We run the algorithm.
. Here are the table results. Here we note that the relationship direction is crucial as it will compare question or tags, depending on the relationship direction.
. And here we see the generated code.
. Finally, we can copy the generated Browser Guide to Neo4j Browser.
. This concludes our look at using the the Jaccard Similarity algorithm in NEuler to create a jaccard value for each node which indicates how many nodes are connected to the same nodes.
