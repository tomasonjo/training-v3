== Preparing your Neo4j Sandbox development environment

To prepare your Neo4j Sandbox development environment you must:

. Login into Neo4j Sandbox.
. Launch a blank database project.
. Start the Neo4j Browser and the Graph Data Science Playground.
. Load some data into your database you will use for the hands-on exercises.

== Step 1: Login into Neo4j Sandbox

To perform the exercises of this course you must login into Neo4j Sandbox.
Go to https://neo4j.com/sandbox/[Neo4j Sandbox website] and click on the *Launch the Free Sandbox* button.
Next, you will need to create a new account or sign in into an existing account.

== Step 2: Launch a blank database project

After a successful login, select the *Blank Sandbox* and click on the *Launch project* to start a new empty database instance.

== Step 3: Start Graph Data Science Playground (NEuler)

[.notes]
--
NEuler is a project of Neo4j Labs and is an excellent way to explore smaller graphs.
--

You can start it by clicking on the *Open* button dropdown and selecting NEuler.

== Datasets you will use in this course

[square]
* Game of Thrones (GOT)
* European Roads
* Recipes

=== Game of Thrones

[.notes]
--
The Game of Thrones network is a monopartite graph containing *Character* nodes and their interactions in the TV shows.
Interactions between characters are grouped by TV shows seasons.
For example, a relationship *INTERACTS_SEASON1* represents an interaction between characters in the first season, *INTERACTS_SEASON2* means interaction in the second season, and so on.
The relationship weight represents the strength of the interaction, and because two characters can interact in more than a single season, we are dealing with a weighted multigraph.

=== European Roads

[.notes]
--
The European Roads network is also a monopartite graph containing *Place* nodes and their road connections indicated by the *EROAD* relationship.
The *Place* node has multiple properties, name and countryCode.
The *EROAD* relationship has four properties, distance, inverse_distance, road_number, and watercrossing.
We will assume that we can traverse each *EROAD* relationship in both directions, effectively treating the European Roads network as an undirected graph.
--

=== Recipes

image::recipe.png[recipe,width=500, align=center]

[.notes]
--
The Recipes network is a bipartite graph containing *Recipe* and *Ingredient* nodes.
A *CONTAINS_INGREDIENT* relationships indicates that an ingredient was used in the particular recipe.
This is a very simple data model where each node has only a name and there are no properties in the relationships.

== Step 4: Start the database and Graph Data Science Playground

. In Neo4j Desktop, start the database.
. Start the *Graph Data Science Graph Playground* Graph App:
.. Double-click *Graph Data Science Graph Playground*  app in the left pane to start it.
.. Once started, it should open a new window as follows:

[.student-exercise]
== Step 5: Load the data for the exercises

Open Neo4j Browser for the started database.
In the query edit pane of Neo4j Browser, execute the browser command:

kbd:[:play 4.0-intro-graph-algos-exercises]

and follow the instructions for *Load the Data for the Exercises*.

[NOTE]
Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes.
