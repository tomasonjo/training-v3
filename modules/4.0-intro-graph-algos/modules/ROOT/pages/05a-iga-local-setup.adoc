== Preparing your local development environment

To prepare your local development environment you must:

. Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system.
. Install the APOC and GDSL plugin libraries for your database.
. Install the Graph Data Science Playground (NEuler).
. Start the database and the Graph Data Science Playground.
. Load some data into your database you will use for the hands-on exercises.

== Step 1: Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system

To perform the exercises of this course you must have downloaded and installed Neo4j Desktop on your system.

ifdef::env-slides[]
. Download the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project in Neo4j Desktop named *Graph Algos*.
. Create a local 4.1.x database in this Graph Algos project.
endif::[]


ifdef::backend-html5,backend-pdf[]
These videos show how to install and get started using Neo4j Desktop.
For your environment you should:

. Download the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project in Neo4j Desktop named *Graph Algos*.
. Create a local 4.1.x database in this Graph Algos project.

[.notes]
--
NEuler is a project of Neo4j Labs and is an excellent way to explore smaller graphs.

=== Install Graph Data Science Playground
endif::[]

. Open the *Graph Apps* pane in the left panel.
. Double-click *Graph Apps Gallery*, a new window opens.
. Click the link for the Graph Data Science Playground install as shown here:

ifdef::env-slides[]
=== Install Graph Data Science Playground (2)
endif::[]

[start=4]
. A new browser tab should open for this address.
. Copy this address to your clipboard. It should be: https://neo.jfrog.io/neo/api/npm/npm/neuler.
. In the left *Graph Apps* panel, paste this address in the *Install* field at the bottom.
. Click *Install*.
. The *Graph Data Science Graph Playground* Graph App should now appear in the left pane.

== Datasets you will use in this course

[square]
* Game of Thrones (GOT)
* European Roads
* Recipes

=== Game of Thrones

image::got.png[Game of Thrones,width=500, align=center]

[.notes]
--
The Game of Thrones network is a monopartite graph containing *Character* nodes and their interactions in the TV shows.
Interactions between characters are grouped by TV shows seasons.
For example, a relationship *INTERACTS_SEASON1* represents an interaction between characters in the first season, *INTERACTS_SEASON2* means interaction in the second season, and so on.
The relationship weight represents the strength of the interaction, and because two characters can interact in more than a single season, we are dealing with a weighted multigraph.
--

=== European Roads

image::european-roads.png[European Roads,width=500, align=center]

[.notes]
--
The European Roads network is also a monopartite graph containing *Place* nodes and their road connections indicated by the *EROAD* relationship.
The *Place* node has multiple properties, name and countryCode.
The *EROAD* relationship has four properties, distance, inverse_distance, road_number, and watercrossing.
We will assume that we can traverse each *EROAD* relationship in both directions, effectively treating the European Roads network as an undirected graph.
--

=== Recipes

image::recipe.png[recipe,width=500, align=center]

[.notes]
--
The Recipes network is a bipartite graph containing *Recipe* and *Ingredient* nodes.
A *CONTAINS_INGREDIENT* relationships indicates that an ingredient was used in the particular recipe.
This is a very simple data model where each node has only a name and there are no properties in the relationships.

== Step 4: Start the database and Graph Data Science Playground

. In Neo4j Desktop, start the database.
. Start the *Graph Data Science Graph Playground* Graph App:
.. Double-click *Graph Data Science Graph Playground*  app in the left pane to start it.
.. Once started, it should open a new window as follows:

[.student-exercise]
== Step 5: Load the data for the exercises

Open Neo4j Browser for the started database.
In the query edit pane of Neo4j Browser, execute the browser command:

kbd:[:play 4.0-intro-graph-algos-exercises]

and follow the instructions for *Load the Data for the Exercises*.

[NOTE]
Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes.
