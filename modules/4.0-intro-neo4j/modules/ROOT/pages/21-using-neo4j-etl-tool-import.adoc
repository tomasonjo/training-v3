== About this module

[.notes]
--
You have learned how to import data into the graph using Cypher, APOC, the neo4j-admin tool, and also using a client application.

Another way that you can import data into the graph is with the Neo4j ETL Tool.
--

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

[square]
* Create a connection to a live RDBMS.
* Customize mappings from the RDBMS to the graph.
* Import data from the RDBMS to the graph.

== Why use the Neo4j ETL Tool for the import?

[square]
* The Neo4j ETL Tool requires that both the source RDBMS and the target DBMS are online.
* It enables you to control how much of the data in an existing RDBMS will be imported into the graph.
* It also enables you to customize how nodes and relationships will be created in the graph.

== Steps for importing with the ETL Tool

. Install the Neo4j ETL Tool into your Neo4j Desktop project.
. Create and start the Neo4j database into which you will import the data.
. Use the Neo4j ETL Tool to import the data:
.. Specify and test the RDBMS connection.
.. Prepare for mapping
.. View the default mapping to be performed.
.. Optionally, modify the default mapping.
.. Perform the import.

== Install the Neo4j ETL Tool

[.notes]
--
In Neo4j Desktop, you either create or view a project that  you have created.
Then you simply click the *Add Application* icon to add the Neo4j ETL Tool.

Here is what your project should look like with the Neo4j ETL Tool added:
--

[small]
--
[NOTE]
Make sure that you have updated Neo4j Desktop so that it has the latest version of the ETL Tool.
At this writing, the latest version is 1.5.0.
--

== Create and start the Neo4j instance

[.notes]
--
To import using the Neo4j ETL Tool, the Neo4j graph into which you will import the data must be started.
For a new project, we simply click add graph and start a new Neo4j instance.
--

[NOTE]
You can skip this step if you plan to use an existing project that already has a Neo4j instance running.

== Create the database you will import data into

[.notes]
--
You will most likely be importing the data into a newly-created database.
--

[source,cypher]
----
create database customers;

Next, you are ready to use the Neo4j ETL Tool for import.

== Starting the Neo4j ETL Tool

[.notes]
--
Here is the initial page you see when you start the Neo4j ETL tool:
--

[small]
--
The first thing you should do is connect to the RDBMS.
--
== Connecting to the RDBMS

[.notes]
--
Here is an example where we are providing the connection information for an existing RDBMS from which we will be retrieving data for the import.
--

== Connection tested and saved

[.notes]
--
You must test and save the RDBMS connection to ensure the Neo4j ETL Tool will be able to access the RDBMS.
--

image::ConnectionSaved.png[ConnectionSaved,width=700,align=center]

== Prepare for mapping

[.notes]
--
After you have connected to the RDBMS, you must select the Neo4j Desktop project and the Neo4j instance to use for the mapping.
--

image::PrepareForMapping.png[PrepareForMapping,width=800,align=center]

[small]
--
You then click *START MAPPING* to begin the  mapping.
--

== Successful mapping

[.notes]
--
If the Neo4j ETL Tool can successfully derive a mapping from the RDBMS, you will see a message that the mapping was successful.
You can clear the message and then click *NEXT*.
--

== Default node mapping

[.notes]
--
For the northwind RDBMS, here is the default mapping that could be used to import the nodes.
--

image::DefaultNodeMapping.png[DefaultNodeMapping,width=800,align=center]

== Default relationship mapping

[.notes]
--
And here is the default relationship mapping.
--

image::DefaultRelationshipMapping.png[DefaultRelationshipMapping,width=800,align=center]

== Changing node labels and what data will be imported

[.notes]
--
In the node tab, you can change the name that node labels will have and also skip data to be imported.
--

image::ChangeNodeLabels.png[ChangeNodeLabels,width=700,align=center]

== Changing node properties

[.notes]
--
You can even change what properties will be imported, their names, and types by selecting the edit icon for a node.
--

image::NodeProperties.png[NodeProperties,width=800,align=center]

== Changing relationship types

[.notes]
--
You can modify the names of relationships and if they will be skipped upon import.
--

image::RelationshipMapping.png[RelationshipMapping,width=800,align=center]

==  Saving the mapping

[.notes]
--
After your customization of the mapping, you should always save it.
--

image::SaveMapping.png[SaveMapping,width=800,align=center]

[.small]
--
Then you click *NEXT* to continue to the import.
--

==  Select the database for import

[.notes]
--
Before you import, you must select the currently started database that you want to import the data into.
--

image::PrepareToImport.png[PrepareToImport,width=800,align=center]

== Import the data

[.notes]
--
You then click *IMPORT DATA* to import the data.

[.student-exercise]
== Exercise 20: Importing data using Neo4j ETL Tool

[.small]
--
. Create a new database in an existing project named northwind.
. Install Neo4j ETL Tool for the project.
. Restart the Neo4j instance.
. Configure a JDBC connection with these guidelines:
.. database name: northwind
.. host: db-examples.cmlvojdj5cci.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
.. user: n4examples
.. password: 36gdOVABr3Ex
. Import the data into the northwind database.
--

[.notes]
--
You will only be able to perform the steps of this exercise if you use Neo4j Desktop.
Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes.
