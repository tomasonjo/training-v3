== Label Propagation (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Label Propagation (Graph Catalog)

The projected graph *roads* should be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you should see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the graph catalog steps again.

== Label Propagation (Overview)

In the Weakly Connected components exercise, you used the weakly connected components algorithm to write component information to each *Place* node.
This property was named *wcc_component*. In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Label Propagation algorithm using the European Roads dataset.
This algorithm enables you to determine discreet sets of nodes that form communities or clusters based upon how they are connected, as well as the optional weight of the connections.

In this exercise, you will:

* *Part 1*: Run the Label Propagation to determine the number of communities and their sizes.
* *Part 2*: Analyze the relationship weight statistics.
* *Part 3*: Run the weighted Label Propagation to determine the number of communities and their sizes.
* *Part 4*: Add a community property to each node using Label Propagation.
* *Part 5*: Inspect the results of the algorithm.

== Part 1: Run the Label Propagation to determine the number of communities and their sizes (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to perform the Label Propagation algorithm on the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: communityCount, communityDistribution.

*Hint*: You will use `gds.labelPropagation.stats`.

Write Cypher code to perform the Label Propagation algorithm on the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: communityCount, communityDistribution.

*Hint*: You will use `gds.labelPropagation.stats`.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stats('roads')
YIELD communityCount, communityDistribution
RETURN communityCount, communityDistribution
----

The results returned should look like this:

The algorithm found a total of 32 communities in the graph.
The largest community has 219 members, while most of the other communities have less than 50 members.

== Part 2: Analyze the relationship weight statistics (Instructions/Solution)

To get a better understanding of the values of the relationship weight properties we will examine their basic statistics.

*Hint*: You will use `apoc.agg.statistics`.

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND ['distance','inverse_distance'] as property
MATCH (:Place)-[r:EROAD]->(:Place)
RETURN property, apoc.agg.statistics(r[property]) as stats
----

The results returned should look like this:

Values of *distance* property are in kilometers. More than half of the distances are below 100km.
The longest road connecting Moskva to Rostov-na-Donu is 1066km long.
On the other hand, most of the *inverse_distance* values have a value of less than 0.02.

== Part 3: Weighted Stats mode (Instructions)

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: communityCount, communityDistribution.
* The relationship weight property name is *inverse_distance*.

*Hint*: You will use `gds.labelPropagation.stats`.


== Part 3: Weighted Stats mode (Solution)

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: communityCount, communityDistribution.
* The relationship weight property name is *inverse_distance*.

*Hint*: You will use `gds.labelPropagation.stats`.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stats('roads',
   {relationshipWeightProperty:'inverse_distance'})
YIELD communityCount, communityDistribution
RETURN communityCount, communityDistribution
----

The results returned should look like this:

What enormous difference does it make!


== Part 4: Add a community property to each node using Label Propagation. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to perform the Label Propagation algorithm on the European road network using these guidelines:

* The algorithm will perform a maximum of 10 iterations.
* The analysis will be done *roads* network we projected in the Graph Catalog section.
* The algorithm will write a property named *community_lpa* to each node with the computed value.
* The weight property name is *inverse_distance*.
* `YIELD` the following results: nodePropertiesWritten, communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.labelPropagation.write`.

== Part 4: Add a community property to each node using Label Propagation. (Solution)

Write Cypher code to perform the Label Propagation algorithm on the European road network using these guidelines:

    maxIterations: 10,
    writeProperty: "community_lpa", 
    relationshipWeightProperty: "inverse_distance" })
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten, communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge
RETURN nodePropertiesWritten, communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge
----

== Part 5: Verify results of the algorithm. (Instructions)

Write a query to return all *community_lpa* values of the *Place* nodes.
For each community id, return the size of the community, and the list of *Place* names.

* Order the results by component size descending.

       count(*) as communitySize,
       collect(node.name) AS places
ORDER BY communitySize DESC 
LIMIT 10

== Label Propagation: Taking it further

. Try using the stream version of the algorithm.
. Try different configuration values, for example number of iterations.
. Try using the *seedProperty* parameter.
