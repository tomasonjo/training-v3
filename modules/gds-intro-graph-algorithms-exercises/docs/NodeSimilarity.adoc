== Node Similarity (Overview)

Similarity algorithms are useful for analyzing datasets to determine how alike nodes are based upon their properties and graph topology.

In this exercise, you will execute Node Similarity algorithm on the Recipes dataset:

* *Part 1*: View the Recipes dataset schema.
* *Part 2*: Find the most common ingredients.
* *Part 3*: Project the Recipes graph to graph catalog with native projection.
* *Part 4*: Run the Node Similarity algorithm to evaluate the distribution of the Jaccard index similarity score.
* *Part 5*: Run the Node Similarity algorithm to add a relationship between a pair of similar recipes.
* *Part 6*: Inspect the results of the algorithm.
* *Part 7*: Recommend similar recipes

Write Cypher code to project the Recipes graph to Graph Catalog using these guidelines:

* The created graph should be named *recipes*.
* Project all *Recipe* and *Ingredient* nodes.
* Project all relationships with a type *CONTAINS_INGREDIENT*.

== Part 4:  Run the Node Similarity algorithm to evaluate the distribution of the Jaccard index similarity score. (Instructions)

Before we infer a similarity network between recipes, we will evaluate the similarity score distribution.
This will help us to fine-tune the *topK* and *similarityCutoff* parameters of the Node Similarity algorithm in the next step.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *recipes*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following result: nodesCompared,similarityDistribution.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.nodeSimilarity.stats`.

The Jaccard similarity score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the two recipes use the exact same ingredients.
On average, a pair of recipes share around 35% of ingredients.
Judging by the *p90* score, only 10% of recipe pairs share more than 55% of ingredients.

== Part 5: Run the Node Similarity algorithm to add a relationship between a pair of similar recipes. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to execute the Node Similarity algorithm on the Recipes dataset using these guidelines:

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *recipes*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* The algorithm will write a relationship with a type *SIMILAR* between a pair of similar recipes.
* The algorithm will write a property named *score* to each relationship with the computed value.
* Specify a similarity cutoff threshold of 0.5.

If we want to try baking something similar to Sourdough, we could try Flatbread, Kitcha, or Sabaayad. 

== Node Similarity: Taking it further

. Change the similarity cutoff and topK parameters to see how it affects the results.
