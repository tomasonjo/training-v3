== Triangle Count (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:{guides}/img/database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Triangle Count (Graph Catalog)

The projected graph *roads* should be stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you should see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the graph catalog steps again.

== Triangle Count (Overview)

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Triangle count algorithm using the European Roads dataset.


* *Part 1*: Retrieve the triangles in the European Roads dataset.
* *Part 2*: Determine the triangle count and clustering coefficient for each *Place* node.
* *Part 3*: Verify results of the clustering coefficient.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Part 1: Retrieve the triangles in the European Roads dataset. (Instructions)

Write a query to return the set of triangles in the graph between *Place* node using the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangle.stream`.

== Part 1: Retrieve the triangles in the European Roads dataset. (Solution)

Write a query to return the set of triangles in the graph between *Place* node using the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangle.stream`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.triangleCount.stream('roads')
YIELD nodeId, triangleCount
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name as place,
       triangleCount
ORDER BY triangleCount
DESC LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Triangle Count: Taking it further

. Write code to add the coefficient property to the *Place* nodes.
. Try using the non-stream version of the algorithms.

== Triangle Count (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Triangle count algorithm to return the triangle count and clustering coefficient for the *Place* nodes of  the European Roads dataset.
