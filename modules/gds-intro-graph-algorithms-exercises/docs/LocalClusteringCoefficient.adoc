== Local Clustering Coefficient (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Local Clustering Coefficient (Graph Catalog)

The projected graphs *roads* and *dach-region* should be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you should see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the graph catalog steps again.

== Local Clustering Coefficient (Overview)

The Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm computes the local clustering coefficient for each node in the graph.
The lcc of a node describes the likelihood that the neighbours of the node are also connected.
It is used to determine how tightly-knit the nodes in a network are.

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher to implement the local clustering coefficient algorithm using the European Roads dataset.

* *Part 1*: Determine the average local clustering coefficient.
* *Part 1*: Determine the local clustering coeffienct for node.
* *Part 2*: Determine the triangle count for each *Place* node.

== Part 1: Determine the average local clustering coefficient (Instructions)

Write a query to determine the average local clustering coeffient for the European road network.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following result: averageClusteringCoefficient.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stats`.

== Part 1: Determine the average local clustering coefficient (Solution)

Write a query to determine the average local clustering coeffient for the European road network.

* Use the roads projected graph
* No other parameters are needed

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stats`.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stats('roads')
YIELD averageClusteringCoefficient
----

The average clustering coefficient has a fairly low value, which indicates that the communities are not tighly-knit.
In a typical online social network you can expect much higher values.

== Part 2: Determine the local clustering coeffienct for node (Instructions)

Write a query to determine the local clustering coeffient for each *Place* node in the European road network.

* Use the roads projected graph
* No other parameters are needed

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream`.

== Part 2: Determine the local clustering coeffienct for node (Solution)

Write a query to determine the local clustering coeffient for each *Place* node in the European road network.

* Use the roads projected graph
* No other parameters are needed

*Hint*: You will call `gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream`.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream('roads')
YIELD nodeId, localClusteringCoefficient
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name as place, localClusteringCoefficient
ORDER BY localClusteringCoefficient DESC
LIMIT 10
----

== Part 3: Verify results of the clustering coefficient.  (Instructions)

Write a query to confirm that the clustering coefficient scores of 1 for the *Bradford* node is correct.

*Hint* You will need to look at the neighbors of *Bradford* node and check if they are also connected between each other.

== Part 3: Verify results of the clustering coefficient.  (Solution)

Write a query to confirm that the clustering coefficient scores of 1 are correct.

Here is the solution code for verifying the clustering coefficient for the *Bradford* node:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH path=(p:Place{name:'Bradford'})-[*..2]-(neighbour)
WHERE (p)--(neighbour)
RETURN path
----

The results should be:

Check out other nodes with a clustering coefficient of 1.


== Local Clustering Coefficient: Taking it further

. Try using the non-stream version of the algorithms.

== Local Clustering Coefficient (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Local Clustering coefficient algorithm to return the clustering coefficient for the *Place* nodes of the European Roads dataset.
