== Weakly Connected Components (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Weakly Connected Components (Graph Catalog)

The projected graphs *roads* and *dach-region* should be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you should see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the graph catalog steps again.

== Weakly Connected Components (Overview)

Weakly connected components algorithm is used to find disconnected components or islands in a graph.

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher code to execute weakly connected graph algorithm using the European Roads dataset.

* *Part 1*: View the European Roads dataset schema.
* *Part 2*: Find all connected places, writing weakly connected components information to the graph.
* *Part 3*: Inspect results of the weakly connected nodes.
* *Part 4*: Inspect smaller disconnected components.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Part 1: View the European Roads dataset schema. (Instructions)

The European Roads dataset contains *Place* nodes that are connected by the *EROAD* relationship. Write a query to view some of the nodes and relationships in this dataset. What are the properties?

== Part 1: View the European Roads dataset schema. (Solution)

The European Roads dataset contains *Place* nodes that are connected by the *EROAD* relationship. Write a query to view some of the nodes and relationships in this dataset. What are the properties?

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH p=(:Place)-[:EROAD]-(:Place)
RETURN p LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

The properties for a *Place* node are *name* and *countryCode*.

The properties for an *EROAD* relationship are *distance*, *inverse_distance*, *road_number*, and *watercrossing*.

== Part 2: Find all weakly connected places, writing their weakly component information to the graph. (Instructions)

A weakly connected component is one where there is a path in any direction between all nodes in the component.
Write the Cypher code to find all weakly connected nodes and set the property *wcc_component* for each node based upon the result of the algorithm.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: nodePropertiesWritten, componentCount, componentDistribution.

*Hint*: You will use `gds.wcc.write`.

Write the Cypher code to find all weakly connected nodes and set the property *wcc_component* for each node based upon the result of the algorithm.

* The algorithm should use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* `YIELD` the following results: nodePropertiesWritten, componentCount, componentDistribution.

*Hint*: You will use `gds.wcc.write`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.wcc.write('roads',{
    writeProperty:"wcc_component"})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten, componentCount, componentDistribution
RETURN nodePropertiesWritten, componentCount, componentDistribution
----

The results returned should look like this:

The algorithm found six components in the graph.
The largest one has 882 members, while the smallest has only two members.

== Part 3: Inspect results of the weakly connected nodes. (Instructions)

Write a query to return all *wcc_component* values of the *Place* nodes.
For each component id, return the size of the component, and the list of *Place* names.

* Order the results by component size ascending.
* Limit the top ten results

== Part 3: Inspect results of the weakly connected nodes. (Solution)

Write a query to return all *wcc_component* values of the *Place* nodes.
For each component id, return the size of the component, and the list of *Place* names.

* Order the results by component size ascending.
* Limit the top ten results

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (place:Place)
RETURN place.wcc_component AS componentId, 
       count(*) AS componentSize,
       collect(place.name) AS places
ORDER BY componentSize ASC
LIMIT 10
----

The results returned should look like this:

The component ids can have different values due to random assignment of ids.
Notice that most of the nodes are in the same component.

== Part 4: Inspect smaller disconnected components. (Instructions)

Write to query to return all components with 10 or less members.
For each component id, return the size of the component, the list of *Place* names, and also their country code.

Update the query to:

* Collect distinct country codes.
* Filter communities with 10 or less members.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (place:Place)
WITH place.wcc_component AS component_id, 
     count(*) AS componentSize,
     collect(place.name) AS places,
    // collect distinct country codes

// filter communities with 10 or less members

RETURN component_id, componentSize, places, countryCodes

     collect(place.name) AS places,
     collect(distinct place.countryCode) AS countryCodes
WHERE componentSize <= 10
RETURN component_id, componentSize, places, countryCodes
----

The results returned should look like this:

One would assume that all the roads in Europe are connected, or at least those in the mainland like Germany and France.
The results show otherwise.

== Weakly Connected Components: Taking it further

. Try different configuration values.
. Try the weighted variant of the weakly connected component algorithm.

== Weakly Connected Components (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher for the weakly connected graph algorithms using the European Roads dataset.
