== Graph Catalog (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:{guides}/img/database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Graph Catalog (Overview)

Because we will be running a lot of algorithms on the European Road network it is best to project it in memory with the native projection.

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher to project the in-memory graph using the European Roads dataset.


* *Part 1*: Project the European Roads network to Graph Catalog.


Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Part 1: Project the European Roads network to Graph Catalog. (Instructions)

Write a query to project the European Road network in memory.

* Project all nodes labeled *Place*.
* Project all relationships with a type *EROAD*.
* Relationships projection should use the *UNDIRECTED* orientation.
* Include *inverse_distance* property as a relationship property.
* Set the default value for *inverse_distance* relationship property to be 1.0.

*Hint*: You will call `gds.graph.create`.

CALL gds.graph.create('roads','Place',

        type:"EROAD",
        orientation:"UNDIRECTED",
        properties:{
            inverse_distance:{
                property:"inverse_distance",
                defaultValue:1.0

== Graph Catalog: Taking it further

. Try projecting the Game of Thrones network.
. Try using the cypher projection

== Graph Catalog (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher to project the in-memory graph using the European Roads dataset.
This procedure enables you to determine to run multiple graph algorithms on the same in-memory graph without projecting it for each algorithm separately.
