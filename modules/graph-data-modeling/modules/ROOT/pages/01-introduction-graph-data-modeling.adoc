== About this module

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Describe what graph data modeling is.
* Describe how Neo4j supports graph data modeling.
* Describe the tools you can use for graph data modeling.
* Describe the workflow for graph data modeling.

== What is graph data modeling?

Graph data modeling is a collaborative effort where the application domain is analyzed by stakeholders and developers to come up with the optimal model for use with Neo4j.
Stakeholders must understand the domain and be prepared to ask detailed questions about how the business-at-hand operates.

Stakeholders are:

[square]
* Business analysts
* Architects
* Managers
* Project leaders

Let's define what we mean -

* when we talk about the task of graph data modeling.

Graph data modeling - is best done as a - *collaborative effort* -

* where the *application domain* is *analyzed* by all *stakeholders*, -
* in order to *create* the best model for the specific problems to be solved.

Stakeholders need to - *agree upon* - the *basic form* - of the *data model*.

* This involves these two areas: -
** (1) First, the semantics - defining what the data means, -
*** along with a - structure  - that represents those semantics.
** (2) Second, is a structure - that can be used -
*** to resolve the questions - that need to be answered.

There is no such thing as an *optimal*. +
As you’ll see today, -

* a *model* is created based on
** our *current knowledge* of the *application domain*, -
** and the *questions* - that we want to answer for that domain.

It’s common for both the *domain* - and the *questions* - to evolve and change over time.

* These changes - inevitably - will also - change the data model.

The key point here - is that you *SHOULD* expect - the model to change.

* One of the *strengths* - of *Neo4j* -
** is that it is - much *more malleable* - than *traditional* databases.

*So, what are stakeholders?*

* Stakeholders - is a *broad term* - that includes anybody -
** that has a *vested interest* -
** in the problem - and the solution - being sought in the data model.

*Stakeholders* are defined as

* *business analyst*, *architects*, *managers*, *project leaders*, *developers*,  and sometimes others.
* Including all the stakeholders - in the process of modeling -
** has the advantage - of melding together - multiple perspectives.
* It brings - different perspectives together,
** Which nurtures a common understanding between the different disciplines.
* This in turn - *increases* - the success rate of projects -
** due to a more thought out model,
** including - the set of questions - guiding developers.

_<NEXT>_

Stakeholder perspectives include

* architects and developers that to build it,
* analysts the use the graph to answer questions,
* managers who need to act upon information derived from the graph.

== How does Neo4j support graph data modeling?

[square]
* Neo4j is a full-featured graph database that allows you to create *property graphs*.
* Applications retrieve data for business use cases by *traversing the graph*.

[.one-third-two-thirds-column]
=== Neo4j Property Graph Model

[square]
* Nodes (Entities)
* Relationships
* Properties
* Labels

On this slide, do a Concept Check.

Ask questions like:

. What information can be attached to a node?  Which of these are required?
.. Labels & properties.  None required
. What information can be attached to a relationship?  Which of these are required?
.. Direction, type, and properties.  Direction and type are required.
. What is the difference between a label and property?
.. Labels are categorical.  Properties are specific.

ifndef::env-slides[]
Nodes and relationships are the key components of a graph.
Nodes should have labels to categorize entities.
Relationships must have direction and type.
Nodes and relationships can have properties.
A label is used to categorize a set of nodes.
Properties are used to provide specific values to a node or relatiobship.

=== Traversal in the graph

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (r:Residence)<-[:OWNS]-(p:Person)
WHERE r.address = '475 Broad Street'
RETURN p
----

[.notes]
--
Traversal means anchoring a query based upon a property value, then traversing the graph to satisfy the query.
In this example, the address property of the Residence node is used to determine where to anchor the query.
Then, the _OWNS_ relationship is traversed to retrieve the qualifying nodes.
A relationship is only traversed once in a query.

Ask the students these questions:
. What uniqueness limitations does Cypher enforce?
.. A query can visit a node any number of times,  but can traverse each relationship only once.
. Given a Cypher query, how does Neo4j decide where to begin traversing?
.. Neo4j will predict which of the node sets in the query is smallest.  It will begin there.  In this case, r is likely to be smallest, as it has a property filter.

== Tools for graph data modeling

[.notes]

There are many ways that developers and stakeholders can work together to build a graph data model for their application.
Drawing it on a whiteboard may be done initially, but you will need to share your model with others so using a tool is recommended.
The tool that we use in this course is the Arrow tool which integrates with Neo4j.
With the Arrow tool, you can generate Cypher statements for creating code to implement the model.

Show the students how to get started with the Arrow tool and encourage them to follow along on their laptops:

. Go to http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/
. Double-click the existing node and add a Caption to it of *Person*.
. Add the properties: *name: "Tom Jones", birthyear: 1990*
. Add another node by clicking the Node button.
. Double-click the new node and add a Caption to it of *Person*.
. Add the properties:  *name: "Mary Jones", birthyear: 1995*
. Grab the edge of the Tom Jones node and drag it over to the Mary Jones node to create the relationship.
. Double-click the relationship and add the Type *MARRIED".
. Add the property:  *since: 2015*
. Add another node by clicking the Node button.
. Double-click the new node and add a Caption to it of *Location*
. Add the property:  *address: "123 Main Street"*
. Drag the edge of the Tom Jones node to the Location property to create the relationship.
. Double-click the relationship and add a Caption to it of *LIVES_AT*.
. Drag the edge of the Mary Jones node to the Location property to create the relationship.
. Double-click the relationship and add a Caption to it of *LIVES_AT*.
. Show them that they can download their model to an SVG file.
. Show them that they can view the markup and save it into a text file.

The resulting model should appear as follows:

== Workflow for graph data modeling

image::GraphDataModelingWorkflow.png[GraphDataModelingWorkflow,width=1200,align=center]

[.notes]
--
Data model maintenance is cyclical and iterative.
We are comfortable with this idea because updating a graph model is much cheaper and easier than updating the schema of a tabular store.
Ease-of-updating will be a consistent theme throughout this training.
