== The Yelp Public Dataset

https://www.yelp.com/[Yelp^] helps people find local businesses based on reviews, preferences, and recommendations.
Over 163 million reviews have been written on the platform as of the middle of 2018.
Yelp has been running the Yelp Dataset challenge 2 since 2013, a competition that encourages people to explore and research Yelp’s open dataset.

As of Round 12 of the challenge, the open dataset contained:

* Over 7 million reviews plus tips.
* Over 1.5 million users and 280,000 pictures.
* Over 188,000 businesses with 1.4 million attributes.
* 10 metropolitan areas.

The https://www.yelp.com/dataset[Yelp dataset^] represents real data that is very well structured and highly interconnected.
It’s a great showcase for graph algorithms that you can also download and explore. You will setup a Neo4j Desktop instance and load this data.

== The Neo4j Graph Data Science Plugin

[.is-half.right-column]

The focus of this course is on using the graph algorithms available in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library. The plugin implements five types of graph algorithms: Path Finding, Centrality, Community Detection, Similarity, Embeddings. The first three are classic graph algorithms and the last two can be used on its own or in combination with the other three.

== Setting up the Yelp dataset in Neo4j Desktop

To complete this course we will use a combination of Neo4j Desktop for hosting the database and your Web application development environment.

[#yelp-dataset-agreement]
--
Before downloading the Yelp data, you need to read and agree to the {uri-yelp-dataset-agreement-pdf}[Yelp Dataset License^].
--

Perform these steps to set up the Yelp dataset in your Neo4j Desktop environment:

. https://neo4j-sandbox-usecase-datastores.s3.amazonaws.com/dump/yelp-41.dump[Download the dump file^,id=yelp-create-sandbox-link]
. Ensure that you have no databases started or connected to in Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project
. Drag the downloaded *yelp-40.dump* file to the *Files* location in your project.
. Click the three dots to the right of the dump file name and select *Create DBMS from dump*.
. Enter a password for the database and then click *Create*.
. Open the details for the DBMS you are working with.
. Click the *Plugins* tab.
. Install *APOC*.
. Install *Graph Data Science Library*.
. Start the DBMS.
. Connect to the DBMS with Neo4j Browser.
. Verify that the nodes and relationships exist in the graph.

You can also follow along with this video for setting up the Yelp dataset in your Neo4j Desktop environment.

[NOTE]
This video is shown with an earlier version of Neo4j Desktop so you will need to adapt for the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.

== Neo4j Browser Guides

[.is-half.right-column]
--
Neo4j Browser Guides are documents that embed text, images, and Cypher queries inside Neo4j Browser in a carousel-like series of slides. We use Neo4j Browser Guides to show how to use graph algorithms in Cypher and Neo4j. Each module will have a browser guide to help "guide" you through the content.
--

You can access the guides for this course by running this command in Neo4j Browser.

== React Web Application

Since this an applied course, we want to see how to enhance features of an actual application.
You will use an existing React application for this part of the course. 
The application is available as a https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/data-science-course-react-app[GitHub repository].

Perform these five steps to set up your development environment:

. Clone the github repository by running `git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/data-science-course-react-app.git`.
. Run `npm install` inside the repository folder.
. Edit the *.env* file by replacing the default environment variables with the credentials for your Yelp Neo4j Desktop instance.
. Run `npm start` to start the application.

=== Building a business reviews application

You will build your own version of yelp.com using this data.
You will use graph algorithms to improve the quality of results in the application.

The rest of the course will follow this structure:

* Introduction to an algorithm.
* Learn how to execute the algorithm using Cypher in Neo4j Browser.
* Use the Cypher and updated graph to improve the React application.


== Exercise

By now, you should have all the tools up and running and talking to each other.

. In Neo4j Browser, complete the steps in the first Neo4j Browser Guide (:play gds-applied-algos-exercises), *Cypher Refresher*.
. In the React web application, confirm that you can now view data in the database by selecting a name in the drop-down (initially selected with Dolores). Data should be retrieved for each user.

The data for Dolores should look like the following:
