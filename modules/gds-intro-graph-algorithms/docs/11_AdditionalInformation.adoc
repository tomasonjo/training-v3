== Monopartite graph

Here be dragons…                            (warning!)

The algorithms are built for monopartite graphs
Monopartite = only one type of node 
Solution: project a monopartite graph (but this only sometimes makes sense)
The algorithms will run … even when they shouldn’t
Most similarity algorithms rely on feature vectors that are the same length
May not always return meaningful results

== Neo4j Cluster

GraphDatabase.driver( "bolt+routing://server?policy=OLAP" )

// neo4j.conf
causal_clustering.server_groups=olap1
causal_clustering.load_balancing.config.server_policies.OLAP=groups(olap1)


== Types of graphs

Tie the flavors of graph back to what it means for running algorithms:

Directed and weighted graphs have more data that can be used as inputs for your algorithms to tune their performance.

Graph density is going to impact your performance (but is also not really a type of graph) but isn't an input.

Cyclic/Acyclic graphs have implementations for some algorithms, but we don't implement any algorithms that require acyclic graphs.

== Other tips

Streaming lots of results with the Neo4j Drivers can be very slow. 
Lots of results = easier to store those and query them afterwards. 
Or, wrap a streamed result in apoc.export.csv.
Avoid writing to core cluster members.
Stream data in a cluster, use snapshot to write results.
Avoid running graph algorithms on a transactional graph
May get unexpected behavior when you write back to the graph.
Similarity algorithms return nonsensical results when vectors are of different lengths.


== Common concerns

Why stream vs store results?
Algorithm takes really long to run.
Betweenness Centrality is slow (all pairs shortest path).
Community Detection gives different results each time.
Resolved by using a "seeding" parameter in Label Propagation and unionFind
Do relationship directions matter?
Triangle Count - ignores direction.
PageRank - an outgoing relationship means you give credibility to the other node.
What about weights? Which algorithms cans I use?
