== How do graph algorithms work?

Stored to project graph

For large graphs,  you should:
Use the explicit graph loader
Load label/relationship - not based on a cypher projection

Decide where to put cypher and native projections

inferred relationships

== How to use graph algorithms

Important: With the stream version of the procedure, no updates occur in the graph. This method is preferable for large graphs because nothing is written to the graph,  but very useful for using results externally.

Mention that you can use some of the algorithms as functions (see the doc).
