== About this module

As a data scientist, you will create Neo4j Databases, add and update data in them, and query the data.
When you learn to use Neo4j as a data scientist, you have two options ⎼  Neo4j Desktop or  Neo4j Sandbox.
In this course you will learn how to setup the Neo4j Desktop for use in the rest of the course, and connect to it from Jupyter Notebook.

In this module, you will:
[square]
* Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system and create a database.
* Install APOC and GDSL for your database.
* Increase available heap memory.
* Set up Jupyter Notebook on your system.
* Download the course notebooks.
* Launch a Jupyter Notebook and connect to the database.
* Launch a Jupyter Notebook to load the database.

== Step 1: Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system

To perform the exercises of this course you must have downloaded and installed Neo4j Desktop on your system.

ifdef::env-slides[]
. Download the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project in Neo4j Desktop named *Link Prediction*.
. Create a local 4.1.x database in this Link Prediction project.
endif::[]


ifdef::backend-html5,backend-pdf[]
These videos show how to install and get started using Neo4j Desktop.
For your environment you should:

. Download the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project in Neo4j Desktop named *Graph Algos*.
. Create a local 4.1.x database in this Graph Algos project.

== Step 2: Install APOC and GDSL for your database

. Click the *Manage* area for the database.
. Select the *Plugins* tab.
. Install the *APOC* plugin.
. Install the *Graph Data Science* plugin.

=== Step 3: Increase available heap memory

The last exercise in this course will require more heap memory than allocated by default.
You will increase the maximum heap memory size to 3gb.

. Click the *Manage* area for the database.
. Select the *Settings* tab.
. Scroll down to *dbms.memory.heap.max_size* settings.
. Overwrite this setting with the following value:
----
dbms.memory.heap.max_size=3G
----
. Click apply.
. Start or restart the database.

=== Step 4: Set up Jupyter Notebook on your system

You can install Jupyter Notebook on your system via pip or conda package managers.

==== conda

If you use conda package manager, you can install Jupyter Notebook with:

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
----

==== pip

You can install Jupyter Notebook with:

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
pip install notebook
----

If you successfully installed Jupyter Notebook, you can run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) to open Jupyter Notebook:

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
jupyter notebook
----

Consult the https://jupyter.org/install[official Jupyter documentation] for more information.

=== Step 5: Download the course notebooks

The notebooks are available on the (https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/ml-link-prediction-notebooks[GitHub repository]).
If you are familiar with Git technology, you can either clone or fork this repository.
Otherwise, you can prepare the notebooks on your system by downloading and extracting the https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/ml-link-prediction-notebooks/raw/main/ml-link-prediction-notebooks.zip
[following package].

=== Step 6: Open a Jupyter Notebook to connect to the Neo4j database.

All the notebooks in this course require a connection to your started Neo4j instance.

Open the *00_Environment.ipynb* notebook and follow the steps to test your connection to the Neo4j database.

=== Step 7: Open a Jupyter Notebook to load the data.

Next, you will import the https://aminer.org/citation[aminer.org citation dataset] into the Neo4j database.

Open the *01_DataLoading.ipynb* notebook and follow the steps to load the data.

== Summary

You should now have set up your development environment:
[square]
* Set up Neo4j Desktop on your system and created a database.
* Installed APOC and GDSL for your database.
* Increased available heap memory.
* Started the database.
* Set up Jupyter Notebook on your system.
* Downloaded the course notebooks.
* Launched a Jupyter Notebook and connected to the Neo4j database.
* Launched a Jupyter Notebook and loaded the data.
