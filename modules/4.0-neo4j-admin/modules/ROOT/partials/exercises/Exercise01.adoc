= Exercise 1: Setting up the Docker instance for this course
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

We are using a Neo4j Enterprise Edition Docker instance for the hands-on exercises in this training, as some Neo4j features are not included in Community Edition.
The underlying OS for the Docker instance is Debian.
In your real application environment, the location of files for managing Neo4j and the terminal commands will be different.
Neo4j Enterprise Edition is available for download with a 30-day evaluation license.

ifdef::backend-pdf[]
You have two ways that you can use the Neo4j Docker image for this training:

. Install Docker on your local system from https://hub.docker.com. This is the preferred method as you will have access to the Docker instance for as long as you need it.
. Access the EC2 instance that has Docker already set up. Use this method if you are in a classroom with an instructor and you cannot set up Docker on your system. Temporary access rights  to the EC2 instance will be given to you by your instructor.

You must Install Docker on your local system from https://hub.docker.com before you can perform the exercises for this training.

== Using the Docker instance on your local system

=== Before you begin

You must install Docker on your system from https://hub.docker.com.

=== Setup steps

. Verify that you have access to docker on your system:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
docker --help
----

image::DockerInstalled.png[DockerInstalled,width=600,align=center]

[start=2]
. Install the Neo4j docker image.
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
docker pull neo4j:4.0.2-enterprise
----
+
. Confirm that the docker instance with the TAG, 4.0.2-enterprise is available:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
docker images
----
+
. Create a directory on your system that you will use for your coursework:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
mkdir $HOME/docker-neo4j
----
+
. Create a script in this new directory named *create_neo4j_instance.sh* that will have the following content if you are using OS X or Linux:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
docker run \
    --name=neo4j \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --volume=$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/data/:/data \
    --volume=$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/logs/:/logs \
    --volume=$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/conf/:/conf \
    --volume=$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/plugins/:/plugins \
    --volume=$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/import/:/import \
    --env NEO4J_dbms_memory_pagecache_size=512m \
    --env=NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes \
    --detach \
    neo4j:4.0.2-enterprise
----
+
  *Note*: Make sure this script has execute permissions.
+
. If you are using Windows (assuming you are using the C drive), create a script in this new directory named *create_neo4j_instance.bat*:
+
[source,script,role=noplay]
----
docker run^
    --name=neo4j^
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687^
    --volume=C:%HOMEPATH%\docker-neo4j\neo4j\data\:/data^
    --volume=C:%HOMEPATH%\docker-neo4j\neo4j\logs\:/logs^
    --volume=C:%HOMEPATH%\docker-neo4j\neo4j\conf\:/conf^
    --volume=C:%HOMEPATH%\docker-neo4j\neo4j\plugins\:/plugins^
    --volume=$C:%HOMEPATH%\docker-neo4j\neo4j\import\:/import^
    --env NEO4J_dbms_memory_pagecache_size=512m^
    --env=NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes^
    --detach^
    neo4j:4.0.2-enterprise
----
+
  *Note*: You may see a popup asking if you want Docker to access your local file system which you should respond yes to.
+
. Run the script to create the Neo4j instance and confirm that it creates the neo4j directory.
. Run the Docker command to see the running instances.
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
docker ps -a

== Using the EC2 instance

=== Before you begin

Ensure that you have been provided with an EC2 instance (IP address) to use by your instructor.
You will use this EC2 instance throughout this course.
Follow the steps below, depending on your OS.

=== Setup steps (OS X and Linux):

. Download the private key, https://neo4j-training.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Lab+VM+Files/neo4j-training.pem[neo4j-training.pem] to your system and place it in your home directory.
. Change permissions on the private key file as follows:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
chmod 400 neo4j-training.pem
----
+
. Open a terminal window on your system.
. Enter the following in the terminal window:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
ssh -i neo4j-training.pem ubuntu@<IP address>
yes
----
+
. You should now be logged in to the EC2 instance.

=== Setup steps (Windows):

. Download the private key, https://neo4j-training.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Lab+VM+Files/neo4j-training.pem[neo4j-training.pem] to your system and place it in your home directory.
. Download https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[PuTTY].
. Install PuTTY by running the install executable using these guidelines:

    Use defaults everywhere but change it so that it creates a desktop shortcut.

image::PuTTYInstallOptions.png[PuTTYInstallOptions,width=500,align=center]

[start=4]
. Open PuTTY.
.. In *Category* panel, select *SSH*.
.. Enter the location where you downloaded the private key.

image::ConfigurePEMPuTTY.png[ConfigurePEMPuTTY,width=400,align=center]

[start=5]
. Continue in PuttY as follows:
.. In *Category* panel, expand *SSH* and click *Auth*.
.. Enter the IP address of the EC2 instance you will be using.
.. In the *Saved Session* field, enter a memorable name.
.. Click *Save*. This will enable you to reuse these configuration settings whenever you want to connect to the EC2 instance.

image::PuTTYSavedSession.png[PuTTYSavedSession,width=500,align=center]

[start=6]
. Connect to the EC2 instance by clicking *Open*.
+
image::OpenEC2FromPuTTY.png[OpenEC2FromPuTTY,width=400,align=center]
+
. You should now have a terminal window for the EC2 instance. Enter *ubuntu* to log in.
+
image::EC2TerminalFromPuTTY.png[EC2TerminalFromPuTTY,width=600,align=center]

=== Confirm that you can start the Docker instance in the EC2 instance (OS X, Linux, and Windows)

. Navigate to the *docker-neo4j* folder.
. Create the Docker Neo4j instance:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
 sudo ./create_neo4j_instance.sh
----
+
. Run the Docker command to see the running instance.
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
sudo docker ps -a
----

== Exercise summary

You have now confirmed that you can start the Docker Neo4j instance that you will use throughout this course to learn about Neo4j Administration.
