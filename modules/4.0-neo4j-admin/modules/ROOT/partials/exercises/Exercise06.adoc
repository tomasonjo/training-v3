= Exercise #6: Modifying the location of the databases
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, you will set up a different location for the databases from where they are placed by default.

If your production system were to use Docker instances, you would simply specify a different location for the data directory (--volume)  when you create the Docker Neo4j instance.

Since a Docker Neo4j instance is already created for this training with volumes mounted in your local filesystem, you will get some experience with specifying a different location for the databases in the Neo4j configuration.

On a non-Docker installation, you would specify this location in the Neo4j configuration as you will do in this exercise.

== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your Docker Neo4j instance for this course.
. Ensure that the Neo4j instance is stopped.
. You should have previously created the dump file, *movies.dump* for the movie database in the *$HOME/docker-neo4j/data* directory.

== Exercise steps:

. Create a directory named *$HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/data/new-location*. This is the directory where the databases will reside which is different from the default location used by Neo4j.
. Make sure that this *new-location* directory is writable.
. Modify the *neo4j.conf* file to use this new location as the data directory. Also ensure that there the default database is _maindb_. Your *neo4j.conf* file should look something like this:
+

[source,config,role=noplay]
----
dbms.default_database=maindb
dbms.directories.data=data/new-location
----
image::NewLocationDocker.png[NewLocationDocker,width=900,align=center]

[start=4]
. Start the Docker Neo4j instance.
. Examine the log file to ensure that the instance started without errors.
+

image::Neo4jStarted-newLocationDocker.png[Neo4jStarted-newLocationDocker,width=800,align=center]

. Examine the files in the *new-location* directory. The instance should have created the *databases* and *transactions* directories. The *databases* directory should look as follows:
+

image::Neo4jStarted-newLocation2Docker.png[Neo4jStarted-newLocation2Docker,width=800,align=center]

. Connect to the _maindb_ database using `cypher-shell`. Did you need to change the password?
. Exit `cypher-shell`.
. Use the `load` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool to create the database, _movies_ from the dump file as follows:
+

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
[sudo] docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/neo4j-admin load --database=movies --from=data/movies.dump
----

. In `cypher-shell` create _movies_.
. Confirm that this _movies_ database has 171 nodes.

== Exercise summary

You have now configured the Neo4j instance to use a different location for the databases.
