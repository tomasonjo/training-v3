== About this module

Next, you will learn how to adjust access to the databases with HTTP ports.

== Configuring connector ports for the Neo4j instance

[.notes]
--
The Neo4j instance uses https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.5/configuration/ports/[default port numbers] that may conflict with other processes on your system.
The ports frequently used are the connector ports:
--

[cols="10,10,80", options="header",stripes="none"]
|====
| *Name*
| *Port Number*
| *Description*
|
{set:cellbgcolor:white}
HTTP
| 7474
| Used by Neo4j Browser. It is *not* encrypted so it should never be exposed externally.
| HTTPS
| 7473
| Requires additional SSL configuration.
| Bolt
| 7687
| Bolt connection used by Neo4j Browser, cypher-shell, and client applications.

=== Default configuration: Connector ports

[.small]
--
Here are the default settings for connector ports:

[.notes]
--
Notice that by default the HTTPS connector is disabled, but the default HTTP port is 7474 and the default bolt port is 7687.
If any of these ports conflict with ports already used on your system, you can change these connector ports by modifying these property values in the *neo4j.conf* file.

== Viewing current configuration values

[.notes]
--
As you configure a Neo4j instance, either for development, testing, or production, it is very important that you know the existing configuration values.
For most Neo4j instances, you can view the *neo4j.conf* file.
Another way that you can view the current configuration values for a Neo4j instance is with a Cypher call:
--

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
// return all configuration values
CALL dbms.listConfig() YIELD name, value RETURN name, value;
----

[.notes]
--
This is particularly useful when using a Docker Neo4j instance where you do not have access to the *neo4j.conf* file used by the instance:
--

== Viewing specific configuration values

If you want to query the current Neo4j instance for particular configuration values, you can use Cypher's WHERE clause to specify the filter.
In this example, we want all configuration properties in the instance that contains the string "http":

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
// return specific configuration values
CALL dbms.listConfig() YIELD name, value WHERE name CONTAINS "http" RETURN name,value;
----

=== Connector ports: Development vs. production

[.notes]
--
In a development mode, clients can connect to the Neo4j instance using the bolt or HTTP connector ports.
This is fine in a development environment only where access from different systems in your network are allowed.
--

[.statement]
By default, a Neo4j instance cannot be accessed by a client running on a different system.
If you want to allow external connections to the Neo4j instance, you must set this property:

[source,config,role=nocopy noplay]
----
dbms.connectors.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
----

[.notes]
--
In production, an application that needs to connect to the Neo4j instance from a different system, should use a secure (encrypted) connection.
But another level of security for a system is to use non-default ports. In this training, we will not be configuring secure HTTPs connectors as we need a real CA for a real company to do this.
You should consult the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/ssl-framework/[SSL documentation] for details in your real, production environment.

Select the correct answers.

[%interactive.answers]
- [x] HTTP
- [x] HTTPS
- [ ] jdbc
- [x] bolt

- [ ] 7687
- [ ] 8000

=== Question 3

[.statement]
What is the effect of setting this property in the *neo4j.conf* file?

----
dbms.connectors.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
----

[.statement]
Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [x] Clients running on a different system can connect to the Neo4j instance.
- [ ] Clients running on a different system cannot connect to the Neo4j instance.

== Summary

You should now be able to change HTTP and bolt ports for your Neo4j instance.
