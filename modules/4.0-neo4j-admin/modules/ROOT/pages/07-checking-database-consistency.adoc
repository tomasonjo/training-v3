== About this module

[.notes]
--
Next, you will learn how to check the consistency of a Neo4j database.
--

At the end of this module, you should be able to use `neo4j-admin` to check the consistency of a Neo4j database.

== Checking the consistency of a database

[.notes]
--
A database's consistency could be compromised if a software or hardware failure has occurred that affects the Neo4j database.
You will learn later in this training about live backups, but if you have reason to believe that a specific database has been corrupted,  you can perform a consistency check on it.
--

[.small]
--
The Neo4j database must be stopped to perform the consistency check.

Here is how you use the `neo4j-admin` tool to check the consistency of the database:
--

[source]
----
neo4j-admin check-consistency --database=<database-name>
                              --report-dir=report-location [--verbose]
----
[.notes]
--
The database named _database-name_ is found in the Neo4j instance.
If the tool comes back with no error, then the database is consistent.
Otherwise, an error is returned and a report is written to _report-location_.
You can specify verbose reporting.
See the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/tools/consistency-checker/[Neo4j Operations Manual] for more options.
For example, you typically check the consistency of a backup which is a best practice you will learn about later in this training.

Suppose we had loaded the *movies2* database with `neo4j-admin`.
Here is what a successful run of the consistency checker should produce:
--
image::ConsistentPassed.png[ConsistentPassed,width=550,align=center]

[.notes]
--
No report is written to the reports directory because the consistency check passed.
--

=== Example: Inconsistencies found

[.notes]
--
Here is an example of what an unsuccessful run of the consistency checker should produce:
--

image::Inconsistencies.png[Inconsistencies,width=700,align=center]

[.notes]
--
If inconsistencies are found, a report is generated and placed in the directory specified for the report location.

Inconsistencies in a database are a serious matter that should be looked into with the help of Neo4j Technical Support.

== Check your understanding

=== Question 1

[.statement]
Suppose that you suspect that one of the user databases in your Neo4j instance has become corrupt.
What is the first thing you need to do?

[.statement]
Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] Back up the database.
- [ ] Shut down the Neo4j instance.
- [ ] Restart the Neo4j instance.
- [x] Stop the database that may be corrupt.

=== Question 2

[.statement]
What tool do you use to check the consistency of a database?

[.statement]
Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] `neo4j-check-consistency`
- [x] `neo4j-admin check-consistency`
- [ ] `neo4j-admin check`
- [ ] `cypher-shell`

=== Question 3

[.statement]
As a best practice, when should you always check the consistency of a database?

[.statement]
Select the correct answers.

[%interactive.answers]
- [x] When an event occurs in your monitoring that makes you suspect a problem.
- [ ] Immediately after start up of the Neo4j instance.
- [ ] Prior to shut down of the Neo4j instance.
- [x] When you back up a database.

== Summary

You should now be able to use `neo4j-admin` to check the consistency of a Neo4j database.
