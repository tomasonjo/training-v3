== About this module
[.notes]
--
In most cases, you will want to automate the management of a Neo4j instance.
--

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Create Cypher scripts to change a database.
* Create shell scripts to execute Cypher scripts.
* Create shell scripts to execute a set of shell scripts.

== Scripting with cypher-shell

[.notes]
--
As a database administrator, you may need to automate changes to databases.
The most common types of changes that administrators may want to perform are related to the application.
As an administrator, you work with architects and developers to create scripts to:
--

[square]
* Create or drop databases.
* Create constraints.
* Create indexes.
* Load data.
* Update data.
* Restructure the graph (change graph data model).
* Add users and access control.

=== Example: Adding constraints - 1

Suppose that we create 3 files to make changes:

*1. AddConstraintsMovies.cypher* that contains the Cypher statements to execute in `cypher-shell`:


[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.title IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE;
CALL db.constraints();
----

[.small]
--
Note that each Cypher statement must end with a `;`.
--

=== Example: Adding constraints - 2

*2. AddConstraints.sh* that invokes `cypher-shell` using a set of Cypher statements and specifies verbose output:

[source,shell,role=nocopy noplay]
----
cat /usr/local/work/AddConstraintsMovies.cypher |
       /usr/bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <InstancePassword>
       --database movies --format verbose
----

[.small]
--
Note that this statement must [.underline]#not# have linefeeds in it.
--

=== Example: Adding constraints - 3

*3. PrepareDB.sh* that initializes the log file, *PrepareDB.log*, and calls the script to add the constraints:

[source,shell,role=nocopy noplay]
----
rm -rf /usr/local/work/PrepareDB.log
/usr/local/work/AddConstraints.sh 2>&1 >> /usr/local/work/PrepareDB.log
# Other scripts here
----

[.notes]
--
When the *PrepareDB.sh* script runs its scripts, all output will be written to the log file, including error output. Then you can simply check the log file to make sure it ran as expected.
Using the Cypher file, together with the run scripts, you can perform something like this to automate changes to a database or set of databases.
