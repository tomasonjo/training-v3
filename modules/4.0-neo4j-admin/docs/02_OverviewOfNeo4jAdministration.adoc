== About this module

[.notes]
--
As a Neo4j database administrator, you will be responsible for ensuring that the deployed Neo4j application runs to meet the needs of its users.
This includes ensuring that the Neo4j software is up-to-date and configured properly, monitoring the use of Neo4j, performing life cycle activities such as backups, and managing multiple Neo4j instances.
--

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Describe common application architectures that use Neo4j.
* Determine which edition of Neo4j to use.
* Determine which deployment option to use.
* Describe the administrative tasks for Neo4j.

== Common application architectures with Neo4j

[.notes]
--
Neo4j can be used in a range of different application architectures.
It is a transactional, real-time store for highly connected data.

Applications connect to a Neo4j database using the binary *Bolt* protocol, which is supported by the official language drivers.
Currently the drivers for .NET, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go are officially supported by Neo4j.
There are also  a set of other language drivers written by the Neo4j community.

A Neo4j client can only access a single database at a time.

== Extending Neo4j
[.notes]
--
Some applications use Neo4j out-of-the-box, and others extend it with additional functionality from libraries that provide specialized procedures.
Examples of these libraries include:
--

[square]
* Neo4j-supported procedures:
** Graph Data Science.
** GraphQL.
* Community-supported procedures, for example the Awesome Procedures of Cypher (APOC).
* Custom-developed procedures for your application.

[.notes]
--
Regardless of which library your application requires, you must ensure that Neo4j is configured to know how to access these libraries.

Your application will include at least one Neo4j user database, but it could include multiple user databases that are accessed by different parts of the application.
A Neo4j instance can support multiple active user databases.

Many deployed applications use Causal Clustering which you will learn about later in this training.
Causal Clustering is an architecture which provides data safety and performance for critical systems that could be distributed all over the world.
--

[NOTE]
Multiple user databases and Causal Clustering are not available in Community Edition.

=== Example architecture #1: Using Neo4j as the primary database

[.notes]
--
Some applications are developed using data that is stored in a single graph.
They can be developed using any language for which there is a driver that can connect to Neo4j.

Each application (Neo4j client) communicates with Neo4j to access the graph using the Bolt or HTTP protocol.
Neo4j-supported and some community drivers use the Bolt protocol.
The clients can be JVMs, .NET resources, a Web server, all of which can be accessed by an end-user.
--

image::Neo4jServerClients.png[Neo4jClients,width=600,align=center]

[.notes]
--
As a Neo4j database administrator, you are responsible for the availability and consistency of the Neo4j databases used by the clients.
--

=== Example architecture #2: Integrating Neo4j with other databases

[.notes]
--
Neo4j is often used in combination with other data sources  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_persistence[polyglot persistence]), such as relational or NoSQL databases.
Data can be fetched from the different systems in order to be manipulated by an application and subsequently written back to Neo4j.
Other solutions can involve loading of data from a number of databases into Neo4j in order to efficiently do connected data analysis on the combined data set.
--

=== Microservices

[.notes]
--
With cloud-hosted microservices, the implementation chosen for the microservice is one that performs best for the type of transaction.
In a cloud-based microservice architecture, there may be a number of services that Neo4j can provide to the end-users.
--

image::Microservices.png[Microservices,width=900,align=center]

[.notes]
--
As a Neo4j database administrator, you are responsible for the availability and consistency of the Neo4j database(s), and for making the data accessible by applications.
Application developers are responsible for the logic in transferring and manipulating data between the databases.
--

=== Example architecture #3: Using Neo4j Causal Clustering 

[.notes]
--
Causal Clustering is used in production environments where high throughput, continuous availability, and reliability are important factors.

With Causal Clusters, you configure multiple Neo4j instances that communicate with each other about updates to the database(s).
Causal Clusters are used when data needs to reside in multiple physical locations, or if you want to implement a high availability architecture where access to data will not be affected if a Neo4j instance goes down.
--

image::ClustersHighLevel.png[ClustersHighLevel,width=700,align=center]

=== Distributed servers in a cluster

[.notes]
--
A common use for Neo4j is when different data is required in a set of geographic locations. For example, an  online retailer may have different data in the US and Europe. Some data could be shared between different geographically located data centers, but the most heavily updated data needs to physically reside closer to the end-user applications. Neo4j Causal Clusters can be configured to span geographic locations.
--

image::ClustersHighLevelDistributed.png[ClustersHighLevelDistributed,width=1200,align=center]

[.notes]
--
As a Neo4j database administrator, you will be responsible for configuring and monitoring Causal Clusters.
You will work with architects to determine the appropriate configuration of the Causal Cluster, taking into account aspects such as: uptime requirements, performance requirements, and redundancy required in order to handle events of Neo4j instance failure or data center failure.
--

=== Architecting distributed servers

Some decisions you may need to make are:
[square]
* Number and locations of data centers.
* Number and location of Core Servers and Read Replicas.
* Sizing of servers (hardware and CPU).
* How to route requests in order to obtain optimal performance.
* Which servers to use as backup servers.

[.notes]
--
We will cover the configuration, management and monitoring of Causal Clusters in depth later in this training.
--

=== Example architecture #4: Using Neo4j standalone for graph analytics 

[.notes]
--
A common use case for Neo4j is for data scientists analyze complex patterns in connected data.
Neo4j Bloom, or some other data visualization tool, may be used as the front-end.


The following are two common patterns this use case:

. Neo4j is used to find and analyze connections in data from other data sources. To cater for this, the Neo4j database is loaded with data from several sources. As a Neo4j database administrator, you will ensure that the Neo4j database used for this purpose is kept up-to-date and that the data is secure and appropriately backed up.
. Data scientists analyze the data in a Neo4j production database. In order to safeguard the production database from potentially heavy queries, a dedicated Read Replica is configured (Causal Cluster) . In this case, the analytics database is always up-to-date with the production database, and its administration is a part of the regular Causal Cluster maintenance work (see Example architecture #3).
--

=== Example architecture #5: Neo4j integrated with compute-heavy solutions

[.notes]
--
Some enterprises need to consolidate large amounts of data for analysis. The data can come from data lakes, NoSQL databases, document stores, relational, all of which is analyzed and placed into a Neo4j database for analytics.
A common  architecture for streaming and analyzing data for consolidation is Apache Spark.
--

image::GraphCompute.png[GraphCompute,width=1000,align=center]

[.notes]
--
As a Neo4j database administrator, you will work with architects to ensure that the Neo4j database in this type of environment is properly configured and available to the computational engines that will write to the graph.
--

== Neo4j versions

All supported versions of Neo4j are available on the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#releases[Neo4j  download page].

[.notes]
--
On the same page, you can also find pre-releases of the next release. These offer an opportunity to explore coming features.
However, it is important to note that functionality in preview releases can be changed without notice.
Additionally, the preview releases are not certified for production use.

_General Availability_ releases are our certified releases.
They include all features and functionalities intended for that version and supported for production deployments.
Production deployments should only use _General Availability_ releases.
--

[WARNING]
Data migration between non _General Availability_ versions is unsupported.

== Neo4j Editions

[.notes]
--
There are two versions of Neo4j to choose from: Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
The version you use will depend on the features you require, the nature of your application that uses Neo4j, and the level of professional support you would like to receive from Neo4j.
--

A full comparison between the Community and Enterprise Editions for the current release of Neo4j can be found at https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/introduction/#editions[Compare Community and Enterprise Editions].

=== Community Edition

The Community Edition is a full functioning version of Neo4j suitable for single database deployments.
It has full support for key Neo4j features, such as ACID compliance, Cypher, and access via the binary protocol and HTTP APIs.

[.notes]
--
It is ideal for smaller internal or do-it-yourself projects that do not require high levels of scaling or professional services and support.
The Community Edition is free to download and use and is available from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#releases[Neo4j  download page] or from the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j[Neo4j GitHub repository].
--

[NOTE]
Many of the Neo4j 4.0 features covered in this training such as multi-database instances and online backup are only supported in Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
=== Enterprise Edition

The Enterprise Edition extends the functionality of the Community Edition to include key features for performance and scalability such as a clustering architecture for high availability and online backup functionality.
[.notes]
--
It is the right choice for production systems with availability requirements or needs for scaling up or out.
Enterprise Edition requires a license from Neo4j.
You can download Neo4j Enterprise Edition from the  https://neo4j.com/download-center/#releases[Neo4j download page].
When you install Neo4j Enterprise Enterprise, you have a 30-day evaluation license and it is expected that beyond the 30-day evaluation period, you will purchase a license that entitles you to technical support.
--

[NOTE]
Neo4j Desktop includes Enterprise Edition so you can fully develop and test an application prior to production.
However, you cannot use Neo4j Desktop for production purposes.

== Installing Neo4j

After you have determined which Edition and version of Neo4j you will install for your application, you should follow the steps outlined in the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/installation/[Neo4j Operations Manual].
[.notes]
--
The instructions include actions that must be taken before installing Neo4j.
--

== Upgrading Neo4j

[.notes]
--
The procedure for upgrading your Neo4j installation will depend upon what release you are upgrading from and to.
If you are upgrading to a major release, the upgrade may include a data migration step.
--

The https://neo4j.com/docs/migration-guide/4.0/[Neo4j 4.0 Migration Guide] provides instructions for upgrading a Neo4j installation to 4.0.

== Supported software and hardware

To install and use Neo4j, the system(s) that host Neo4j Enterprise Edition have specific requirements for:

[square]
* JVM
* Operating system
* Hardware architecture
* Memory
* Disk
* Filesystem

[.statement]
You should consult the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/installation/requirements/[System Requirements] to learn more.

== Neo4j deployment options

Early in the development of an application, a decision will be made whether to deploy:

. Neo4j instance(s).
. Neo4j embedded within the application.
. Neo4j in the Cloud.

=== Server mode deployments

[.notes]
--
This is the most common deployment, and it is recommended for all on-site deployments that do not require embedded mode.
In this architecture, Neo4j runs as a database server and can be accessed through binary and http APIs for data querying and updating.
--

image::ClientServerDeployment.png[ClientServerDeployment,width=800,align=center]

==== Key advantages of server mode

[square]
* *Binary Bolt Protocol* or HTTP APIs allows clients to send requests and receive responses over the wire.
* When using one of the supported drivers together with Causal Clustering, *load balancing* is provided by Neo4j. It can also be configured to meet specific criteria.
* Supports *Platform independence* for the client/application accessing the server APIs due to dedicated language drivers.
* Can utilize Neo4j and query language extensions via user-defined procedures.
* The database is managed independently from the application.
* Neo4j instances are easy to configure and provision in production.

==== Server mode for the Neo4j administrator

When deployed as a server, you should expect to perform many common administration, configuration, and troubleshooting tasks as you would for any database deployment.
Neo4j provides utilities and tools for enabling these capabilities, which you will learn about later in this training.

[.notes]
--
This training will primarily emphasize the production decisions and administrative tasks associated with a server mode deployment.
--

=== Embedded deployments

[.notes]
--
This architecture is more common in OEM setups, where Neo4j runs integrated as part of a third party product. When Neo4j is embedded directly into an application, you get all the functionality of the database directly accessible through the Java APIs used by the application code.
This makes it very easy to directly work with the database and get lightning fast performance.
--

image::EmbeddedDeployment.png[EmbeddedDeployment,width=400,align=center]

==== Key advantages of embedded mode

[square]
* Low latency: Since Neo4j is in the application, there will be no network overhead.
* Choice of APIs: Access to a diversity of APIs for creating and querying data via the Neo4j Core API, traversal framework, and the Cypher query language.

==== For the Neo4j  administrator

Your hands-on administration work with Neo4j is very minimal with embedded deployments.

[.notes]
--
Most of the core administration tasks, such as initiating backups, monitoring, and configuration should be built into the application that is embedding Neo4j.
--
=== Neo4j in the Cloud

Neo4j has been successfully hosted in these environments:

[square]
* Neo4j Aura
* Amazon EC2
* Google Cloud (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure
* Kubernetes

[.notes]
--
To learn more about Neo4j Cloud deployments see the https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-cloud-deployment/[Developer Guide to Cloud Deployment] that is updated regularly.
--

== Administrative tasks for Neo4j

[.notes]
--
There are many common administrative tasks for a server mode deployment:
--

[square]
* *Managing a Neo4j database*
* *Managing plugins used with the Neo4j database*
* Managing logging
* Monitoring queries
* *Backing up and restoring databases*
* Managing Causal Clusters
* Managing database security
* *Importing data*

[NOTE]
