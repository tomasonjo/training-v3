== About this module

Next, you will learn how to set up the Neo4j instance to use a specific, non-default location for the databases.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Modify the location where Neo4j databases are placed.


== Modifying the location of the database

If you do not want the databases used by the Neo4j instance to reside in the same location as the Neo4j installation, you can modify its location in the *neo4j.conf* file. If you specify a new location for the data, it must exist in the filesystem and the directory must be owned by _neo4j:neo4j_.

Here we have specified a new location for the data in the configuration file:

In addition, we have specified mainDB as the default database.

=== Best practice for configuration modifications

Here is a best practice you should follow when managing a Neo4j installation.
It is easier to place all changed property values at the end of the *neo4j.conf* file.
That way, you can easily see what non-default values you have configured.

Here is an example:

=== Starting Neo4j instance with a new location

After you have modified the *neo4j.conf* file with the new location for the databases, you must:

. Ensure the directory exists.
. Change the owner of the directory to be neo4j.
. Start or restart the Neo4j instance.
. Confirm that the instance started with no errors.

When you start the Neo4j instance using a different location for the databases, it first creates and starts a database named whatever you have specified as the default database.
If you did not specify the default database in the configuration file, it will create a database named _neo4j_.

Here are the new databases in the new location:

If you have existing databases that you want to reside in a different location for the Neo4j instance, remember that you must dump and load the databases to safely copy them to the new location.

==== Password change required

Just as you needed to change the password for the admin user, neo4j the first time you accessed a database, you must do the same here for this new location of the Neo4j databases:

== Check your understanding

=== Question 1

What file must you modify if you want the location of the databases for your Neo4j instance to be located in a non-default directory?

Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] *database.conf*
- [ ] *neo4j-database.conf*
- [ ] *neo4j-instance.conf*
- [x] *neo4j.conf*

=== Question 2

The directory/folder that will be used for the Neo4j instance databases must be owned by which user:group?

Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] root:root
- [ ] neo4j:root
- [x] neo4j:neo4j
- [ ] root:neo4j

=== Question 3

Suppose you configure a new location for the databases for the Neo4j instance.
After the Neo4j instance starts, what are the first things you must do?

Select the correct answers.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] Create the system database.
- [ ] Create the user database.
- [x] Ensure the Neo4j instance successfully starts.
- [x] Change the password for the _neo4j_ user.

== Summary

You should now be able to:

[square]
* Modify the location where Neo4j databases are placed.
