== Exercise 1: Accessing the Neo4j Enterprise Edition EC2 instance for this course

We are using Neo4j Enterprise Edition for the hands-on exercises in this training, as some Neo4j features are not included in Community Edition.
The OS that we will use for this training is Debian.
In your real application environment, the location of files for managing Neo4j and the terminal commands will be different.
Neo4j Enterprise Edition is available for download with a 30-day evaluation license.


=== Before you begin

Ensure that you have been provided with an EC2 instance (IP address) to use by your instructor.
You will use this EC2 instance throughout this course.
Follow the steps below, depending on your OS.

=== Exercise steps (OS X and Linux):

. Download the private key, https://neo4j-training.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Lab+VM+Files/neo4j-training.pem[neo4j-training.pem] to your system and place it in your home directory.
. Change permissions on the private key file as follows:

----
chmod 400 neo4j-training.pem
----

[start=3]
. Open a terminal window on your system.
. Enter the following in the terminal window:

----
ssh -i neo4j-training.pem ubuntu@<IP address>
yes
----
[start=5]
. You should now be logged in to the EC2 instance.
. Find the Neo4j Operations Manual and confirm that the files on your EC2 instance (Debian) match the locations of files in the Operations Manual.

*Hint*: Confirm that files are installed as described https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/configuration/file-locations/[here].
