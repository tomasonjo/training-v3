= Exercise #11: Managing backups
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, you will perform an online backup of a database where you use the same host for the backup process.
Then you will modify the database.
Finally, you will restore the database from the backup to see that it was successfully restored.

[NOTE]
In your real application, if you were to back up a production stand-alone Neo4j instance, you would use a different host from the host that is running the Neo4j instance.

== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your Docker Neo4j instance (neo4j) for this course.
. Stop the Docker Neo4j instance.

== Exercise steps:

. Modify the Neo4j configuration so that online backup is enabled and will be done on this same host.
For example, your *neo4j.conf* properties should look something like this:
+

----
dbms.backup.enabled=true
dbms.backup.listen_address=localhost:6362
----

. Start the Docker Neo4j instance.
. View the logs to make sure it started with no errors.
. Since we are using Docker for our training exercises, you must create a directory that is accessible from the Docker Neo4j instance. Create the following directory in the $HOME/docker-neo4j/neo4j/logs directory named *backups* and ensure that it has all permissions (chmod 777 backups).
. In `cypher-shell`, make sure that all database are started. There should be four databases:
** system
** maindb
** movies
** movies2
[start=6]
. Confirm that the movies database has 171 nodes:
+

----
:USE movies
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

. Perform an online backup of the _system_ database using these guidelines:
.. Perform a consistency check.
.. Use the *backups* directory for the location of the backup.
.. Use the *reports* directory for the report location.

----
[sudo] docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/neo4j-admin backup --backup-dir=logs/backups --from=localhost:6362 --check-consistency --database=system --report-dir=logs/reports
----

The result of the backup should look something like this:

image::BackupSystemDocker.png[BackupSystemDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=8]
. Repeat the backup procedure for the user databases
** maindb
** movies
** movies2
[start=9]
. In `cypher-shell` drop the _movies_ database.
. Use the restore tool to restore the _movies_ database.
+

----
[sudo] docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/neo4j-admin restore --from=logs/backups/movies --database=movies
----

. In `cypher-shell` create the _movies_ database that was just restored.
. Confirm that the _movies_ database has 171 nodes.
+

----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

. Exit `cypher-shell`.
. Invoke `cypher-shell` to add nodes to the _movies_ database using the *movies.cypher* file.

On OS X or Linux:

----
cat ~/docker-neo4j/files/movies.cypher | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell --database movies -u neo4j -p <passwordYouSpecified>
----

On Windows:

----
type files\movies.cypher | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell --database movies -u neo4j -p <passwordYouSpecified>
----

[start=15]
. In `cypher-shell` confirm that the database contains 342 nodes:
+

----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

. Perform an online backup using these guidelines:
.. Back up the _movies_ database.
.. Perform a consistency check.
.. Use the *backups* directory for the location of the backup.

The result of the backup should look as follows:

image::BackupMoviesDocker.png[BackupMoviesDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=17]
. Invoke `cypher-shell` to add more nodes to the _movies_ database using the *movies.cypher* file.

On OS X or Linux:

----
cat ~/docker-neo4j/files/movies.cypher | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell --database movies -u neo4j -p <passwordYouSpecified>
----

On Windows:

----
type files\movies.cypher | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell --database movies -u neo4j -p <passwordYouSpecified>
----

[start=18]
. In `cypher-shell` confirm that the database contains 513 nodes:
+

----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
----

. Next, you will restore the _movies_ database to the one that has 342 nodes. Stop the _movies_ database.
. Restore the _movies_ using these guidelines:
.. Use the same _backups_ location.
.. Specify _force_ so that the database will be replaced.

----
[sudo] docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/neo4j-admin restore --from=logs/backups/movies --database=movies --force
----

[start=21]
. Connect to the Neo4j instance with `cypher-shell`.
. Start the _movies_ database.
. Confirm that the _movies_ database has 342 nodes.


== Exercise summary

You have gained experience backing up all databases, backing up a single database, and restoring a database.
